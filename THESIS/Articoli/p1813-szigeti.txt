Tangible user interfaces and physical representations of
data are both promising approaches to improving
insights derived from large data sets. Interactive
tangible representations of data, which seamlessly
combine those two approaches, potentially take
advantage of cognitive processes, data representations,
and interactions not supported by current approaches
and may enhance collaboration. This paper describes
user evaluations of two sets of prototypes comprised of
physical blocks to represent data. One set uses six
blocks of identical dimensions and another set uses six
blocks with different dimensions. The objectives of this
pilot study include (i) making general observations on
how users interact with the two prototypes, (ii) making
observations on the role these tangible interfaces play
in collaboration, and (iii) comparing the two sets of
tangible interfaces. We report on the results of the
study and discuss future work.

Introduction

We present the results of a pilot study in which we
compare two sets of TUIs that are used to interrogate
and represent data on radio station listening
demographics. Both TUIs consist of a set of blocks,
where each block represents a single radio station. The
uniformly-sized set (see Figure 1) comprised six blocks
of identical dimensions and the data-sculpture set (see
Figure 2) comprised six blocks with dimensions
representing the number of radio listeners (height) and
the total time they listened (depth) in a 24 hour period

Physical representations of data combine cognition,
representation and interaction in novel ways, offering
the potential for discovering insights into a data set
that traditional WIMP based approaches may not.

and the depth of the block represents

As interest in the physical representation of data
continues to grow, research has focused on one of two
different but related facets: the tangible interface as
input and physical representations as output.

Background and motivation

The user evaluation also considered the role of
collaboration, which may be a key differentiator
between tangible and WIMP style interfaces. Lee et al
argue that analysis should include not only the user,
but the potential social dimensions of the interaction
which takes places when users engage with each other
while navigating physical devices [11].

Tangible user interfaces (TUI) afford interactions that
push the boundaries of traditional WIMP interfaces,
including the direct manipulation of 2D graphical forms
[4], the use of gesture [11] and 3D space [11][1].
Research in TUI explore possible improvements to how
we can interact with data sets and computer models,
particularly with regard to learning [3][12] and
collaborative work [8]. Kim and Maher, for example,
compared Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) with TUI in a
collaborative design task, finding that the groups using
TUI performed multiple cognitive actions in a shorter
time, made more unexpected discoveries of spatial
design features, and exhibited more problem-finding
behaviours [8].
Physical data representation is the materialization of
data into physical artefacts, which may offer more
intuitive approaches to data analysis and lead to
insights into data sets [13]. Although we are only
beginning to understand the efficiency of physical
visualization, evaluations have found that in some
circumstances they outperform on-screen equivalents
when retrieving information and that the component of
touch appears to be a key cognitive aid [6][7].

Methodology
We undertook two user evaluation sessions, each of
which involved four participants. Participants were first
asked to complete ten tasks in response to questions1
using one set of blocks. The procedure was then
repeated using the other set of blocks. The order of the
sets was counterbalanced to prevent order bias. Both
sessions were video and audio recorded and lasted less
than one hour.

Questions were based on queries that may be asked using
existing data visualization software. For example, participants
were asked to determine which radio station had the greatest
number of male listeners between the ages of 44 to 55.

The user interaction of the low fidelity prototypes was
simulated using a Wizard of Oz technique.2 Participants
were also asked to complete a post-study survey.
Data Sets
Compiled by BBM Canada, the data consisted of
detailed demographic information on radio listeners and
the media consumption habits of market research
participants collected on April 1, 2013 for the Toronto
area in Canada.
Apparatus
In addition to the two sets of blocks described above,
six cards were used to represent additional data
variables: radio format, ownership, age range, sex
(gender), household status, and household size (see
Figure 3). Sheets of paper were placed on the table
between the participants to represent a surface on
which the blocks and cards could be placed to produce
a visualization of the data. A wall mounted screen was
positioned in front of the participant group, on which
the resulting visualizations appeared3.

data category cards

Participants
The eight participants were BBM Analytics employees,
who were over 25 years old, had at least one year of
experience, and were familiar with data visualization
software, although their familiarity with the specific
data set used in the study varied. The two groups were

This technique allows for rapid prototyping and evaluation since
the interactions between the user and the tool are simulated
by researchers (see the work of Greenberg, Carpendale,
Marquardt & Buxton [5] for a more details regarding a
technique first proposed by Jeff Kelley.)
Note that not all the potential combinations of blocks and cards
could be anticipated and displayed. Researchers described the
visualization where an actual visualization did not exist.

composed of 2 men and 2 women, and 3 women and 1
man respectively.
Procedure
The first group completed the ten questions using the
uniformly sized set and then the data-sculpture set,
whereas the second group began with the datasculpture set and then used the uniformly-sized set.
While the pilot study did not compare 2D with TUI, we
wanted to allow for a discussion of the relevance of TUI
in the context of the participant’s work. Hence we
asked questions that were similar to queries study
participants would perform in the course of their work
using existing 2D analytic software. The questions
started simply and increased in complexity (see Figure
4, 5 and 6 for illustration of how a query could be
answered by manipulating the blocks and cards on a
sensor pad and viewing the resulting visualization on a
screen).
Measures
The primary variable in the study was the different set
of blocks. The uniformly-sized set used colour and a
written label to represent specific radio stations. No
other data variable was physically represented. The
data-sculpture set included a physical visualization of
the total listening time for each radio station and the
total audience embodied in the dimensions of the block.
We captured audio and video recordings to allow us to
measure the time to complete tasks, error rate and to
capture inter-participant interaction during completion
of the tasks.
We asked the participants to complete an online survey
immediately following their session, in which they
answered questions regarding perceived collaboration,
usability of the prototype (using the System Usability

Scale), preferences between the sets, and potential
uses of TUIs.

Collaboration and engagement
Overall, both user sessions provided examples of
collaboration and active participation. However, there
were some notable differences between the use of the
uniformly sized set and the data-sculpture set of
blocks. We defined collaboration as social interaction
(handling the blocks, discussing how they should be
used and helping formulate answers). This was greater
with the data-sculpture set of blocks, which participants
recognized in the survey.
Usability
We did not observe any differences in the handling of
the blocks, all of which were light enough to be handled
by one-hand. Participants were asked to rate the use of
blocks to analyze the data. Using the System Usability
Scale (SUS) for measurement, the average score of the
seven respondents was 76.4. A SUS score above 68 is
considered above average [2]. Only one participant
gave the system a score below this benchmark (their
score was 60). An average score of 76.4, supported by
positive commentary from participants, suggests that
they found the block TUI valuable for the analysis of
data. Six of seven survey respondents agreed with that
statement that the blocks are a useful way to explore
the data, and five of seven agreed that this method of
analyzing data would lead to new insights.
Preferences
When asked regarding their preference for either set,
four out of seven of the respondents preferred the
uniformly sized set, citing a belief that they led to more
insight regarding the data. In addition, six of the seven

participants who responded to the survey question
“which set helped you complete your task more
quickly?” felt that the uniformly sized set was more
efficient (the seventh participant did not indicate a
difference between the two sets). The sessions revealed
some confusion regarding the data-sculpture set and
that the inclusion of data in the TUI may have been a
confounding (instead of an enlightening) factor. It is
possible that the data-sculpture set required more
training for effective use than the uniformly sized set.
One participant felt that physically representing two
important facets of a radio station’s data gave her an
immediate impression of the station relative to other
stations, an impression she did not get from the
uniformly sized blocks. However, none of the questions
were answered by the participants using only the
physical aspects of the block (ie. without recourse to
the flat surface and screen display.)
Potential Uses
Participants were asked if specific types of data would
lend themselves to the use of blocks for analysis;
specific data sets used in the course of work were
proposed. This finding will be used to select data sets in
future development work and evaluation. Participants
also compared existing 2D visualizations (which are
generated by existing software tools to analyze the
data sets comparable to those used in this study) with
the use of blocks, generally finding that the block
concept held potential in revealing insight that existing
tools did not. As one participant commented,
I think the blocks will work for any data that has a
common base as the 3D shape has an advantage over
common 2D visualizations to display different facets
of the data in a more manageable fashion. I also find
that manipulating the blocks is easier than checking

off a list of boxes to find the results you want. I felt
like the visual aspect of the block forces the brain to
see data differently and prompts questions that a bar
graph or histogram wouldn't necessarily provoke.
Although efficiency was not a key measurement in the
study, the time to complete tasks (the time taken to
answer each question) was also recorded. The time to
complete tasks with the uniformly sized set was half
that of the data-sculpture set for both groups.

Discussion
Participants in both user sessions expressed a keen
interest in TUI, finding the use of blocks to be fun,
although this may have been a product of novelty. The
pilot study helped us to test various ideas and beliefs
we held regarding the use of TUIs. For example, we
believed that the data-sculpture set would lead to more
efficient responses to our questions since potential
answers were embedded within the physical
representation of the data, but this was not the case.
Even though participants could line up the blocks and
see differences in terms of height, for example, the
presence of other aspects of the data (as represented
by the depth) may have caused some uncertainty,
reducing efficiency. At times the participants were
unsure of the correct orientation in which to place the
blocks; perhaps more training time prior to making use
of the blocks could have increased efficiency.
The efficiency of using blocks to analyze data remains
unclear and requires further study. In this pilot study,
we focused on gathering qualitative data on how users
interacted with the TUIs, on how the TUIs spurred
social interaction, and on how each of our two TUIs
compared with one another. We were therefore more
interested in recording the spontaneous group

discussions that arose among participants, rather than
measuring efficiency, and thus we are hesitant to make
any claims regarding efficiency. We believe that the
information gleaned from these tangential group
discussions is more useful to us at this time than timeto-complete tasks measurements because we are still
in the process of determining which specific affordances
are most relevant to the user. The group discussions
informed possible ways that a query may be answered,
such as placing blocks on different parts of the input
surface, stacking, and rotating the angle of the blocks
in relation to each other and to the participants. This
interaction between participants suggests a need to
further study the use of a TUI and whether it may
instigate social interactions. Social instigation may need
to be balanced against efficiency as social interaction
may improve the effectiveness or quality of data
analysis [8] [12].

Future Work
The pilot study involved only eight participants, but it
allowed us to share the concept with a potential user
group. We would like to better understand the
differences of data sculpture approach versus non-data
sculpture and the possible affordances of physical
blocks. We would also like to better understand the role
of colour on the perceptions of data. However, we
believe there are properties beyond efficiency that hold
promise for TUI, such as improved collaboration and
accessibility. We would like to better understand the
role of collaboration in the use of TUIs, particularly if
collaboration reveals novel insights from data. In other
words, to what degree can TUIs facilitate human to
human to computer interaction so that we may uncover
currently hidden facets of a data set. Contemporary
artists have led in the creation of evocative data

sculptures, a burgeoning art practice which may bear
future value in providing clues to effective formal
expression in the use of TUIs [14].
