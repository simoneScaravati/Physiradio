opportunities to create dynamic embedded physicalizations. In particular, we see new challenges arising in the context of personal
and casual physicalizations at home. In this paper, we discuss the research directions and potential benefits of dynamic embedded
physicalizations in the residential context, or Embedded Personal Physicalizations.

I NTRODUCTION

AND

M OTIVATIONS

The field of visualization is at a tipping point. As computers have
transitioned from massive corporate calculators to personal computers
to mobile devices, visualization is also becoming increasingly personal.
Visualization has already moved from supercomputers for scientific
visualization to desktop tools for information visualization, data science
and data journalism.
Nowadays we generate massive amounts of personal data using devices and sensors such as “smart” meters and thermostats in our homes;
personal devices such as Fitbit trackers, mobile phones, and smart
watches on our bodies. However, this data is not readily available for
the individuals to make sense of or get empowered for better decision
making and behavior change. We argue that for visualizations to become personal, ubiquitous, and play a major role in our everyday lives,
we need to explore new technologies and approaches to visualizing
data, designed specifically for a personal usage context. There is a
need to design interfaces so that this data is used to amplify people’s
cognition and help them make informed decisions.
In this paper we argue that embedded personal physicalizations, that
can leverage multimodal interactions, ambient visualizations, peripheral
attention, and social group discussions, are a promising approach to
tackling this challenge. We start by discussing related work around
ambient personal visualizations, ubiquitous interfaces and robotics,
actuated physicalizations, and embedded visualization. Building on
these bodies of work, we illustrate opportunities for physicalizations
at home through a scenario. We further discuss the challenges and
research directions of embedded personal physicalizations.
1.1

Ambient Personal Visualizations

There has been a growing interest in personal visualization and personal
visual analytics, which brings forth the question: “How can the power
of visualization and visual analytics be made appropriate for use in
personal contexts – including for people who have little experience
with data, visualization, or statistical reasoning?” [4]. There is also
evidence that people can engage in the act of constructing personal
visualization at home, promoting self-reflection [22]. One of the key
aspects of these artifacts is their physical presence within people’s
intimate spaces, and how they can “serendipitously spark reflection”
and facilitate “continuous awareness” [22].
In their discussion of casual information visualization [15], Pousman
et al. argue that ambient visualizations produce awareness insights –
insights that come from maintaining awareness of a data stream. For
example, the act of linking information, such as an one’s Fitbit activity

levels with the visible health of one’s house plant, amplifies awareness
of one’s overall health [1]. Such ambient visualizations can have a
persuasive role in a personal context [13]. Displays are also becoming
increasingly smaller thus better suited to personal use [13]. It is also
important to convey information in a “subjectively pleasant way” in a
personal context [13]. This aligns with the observation that people who
craft personal visual narratives using visualization introduce subjective
elements at all stages of the visualization creation process [23].
1.2

Ubiquitous Interfaces and Robotics

Zooids [11], small wheeled-robots capable of moving on horizontal
surfaces and sensing user input. Zooids enable versatile creation of
ubiquitous robotic interfaces [9]. These can move, manipulate, sense,
display, and interact with both user and environment thus enabling to
create rich interactive spaces. Similarly, Cellulo robots [14] allow to
create tangible user interfaces for diverse learning applications. Each
robot can accurately move in space and deliver haptic feedback to
leverage kinesthetic learning.
1.3

Actuated Physicalizations

Data-in-Place [21] explores ambient dynamic physicalizations to better
understand their impact and how it can be used to improve the life of
communities, at street level. Building on shape-changing interfaces,
Taher et al. [20] introduced Emerge, a dynamic physicalization of a
3D barchart alongside interaction techniques to support information
exploration tasks. Dynamic composite physicalization [12] constitute a
subclass of physicalizations made of multiple elements whose topology
can be reconfigured, or can reconfigure itself. We presented our implementation of dynamic composite physicalizations using Zooids [11].
1.4

Personal Physicalizations

Stusak et al. [19] explored physicalizations as representations of personal data such as tracked running activity, and showed that the resulting sculptures engage users in reflective processes and trigger social
interactions. Huron et al. [5] showed how physicalizations can help
users with no prior experience in infovis create, use and explain visual
representations of personal data.
1.5

Embedded Visualizations

In his talk “Seeing Spaces” [24], Victor depicts a maker space that
allows makers to prototype and design using advanced seeing tools.
This space contains the technology to capture and display information
so that makers can observe and understand complex behaviors, keep
track of the captured data, and compare parallel design variations in the
resulting implementations. By capturing and representing information
concurrently in context, makers have direct and easy access to large
amounts of information, which would otherwise be complex to distill
and cumbersome to acquire with traditional tools. Willett et al. [25]
coin these as embedded data representations, representations that “are
made up of multiple physical presentations that each independently
display data related to their respective physical referent”. Embedded
physicalizations are precised as “consisting of materials or objects that
are associated with the data referents”.

Meanwhile, the mother wants to install a new wall light in the living
room. To help her find an appropriate location for the lamp, a group
of Zooids climb on the walls and start scanning the surface to find the
location of wall studs and electric cables in the wall. The Zooids align
to create a line following electric cables, and synchronously flash their
light in yellow to depict lightning and signify danger. Meanwhile, other
Zooids detect the multiple studs to indicate potential locations for the
new lamp. With these Zooids representations, the mother can now see
in-situ the constraints and the potential spots for her new light fixture.
From the multiple choices, she decides on an optimal location where
the lamp will not only be supported by a stud while remaining close to
electric cables, but also near her couch where she can do her evening
reading. Happy with her choice, she starts drilling away safely.

We extend these with embedded personal physicalizations, that
we define as embedded visualizations that are physical representations
of data in a personal context such as a home. With embedded personal
physicalizations, we aim to create pervasive and seamless representations of information in casual contexts, by leveraging the low spatial
indirection of embedded physicalizations. While they come with new
challenges, we envision that embedded personal physicalization will
empower people by augmenting their awareness and understanding of
their environment, and inform decision making.

O PPORTUNITIES

FOR

P HYSICALIZATIONS

AT

H OME

With new technology come new opportunities for personal physicalizations at the junction of ubiquitous computing, robotics, and casual
and personal visualizations. Recent advances in Internet of Things
and ubiquitous computing, alongside with the widespread adoption of
quantified self and smart devices, now facilitate the creation of large
networks of sensors that collect data in a wide range of environments.
This information can then feed embedded visualizations in real-time.
Traditional sensors can be distributed across the house as well as
the power grid to collect, monitor, and provide information regarding
utilities consumption (electricity, water, gas) [16], ambient air quality
(e.g., presence of dangerous gases such as carbon monoxide), ambient
temperature, illumination conditions, or human presence.
This collection of data can already provide residents with statistics
and trends, to raise awareness regarding their own behavior. Yet in this
personal context, phone applications or websites can seem intrusive
or patronizing and raise privacy concerns. A relatively recent study
also found that both the aesthetics of the representation and the context of use need to be considered when designing visualizations for
environmental and resource consumption data in people’s homes [17].
In this section we present situations depicting the daily life of a
family whose house is equipped for data collection and embedded
physicalizations. We illustrate this system with a potential variation
of Zooids [11] (and thus not yet implemented), for which each robot,
equipped with a variety of sensors, could move freely within the house.
2.1

Saturday afternoon. While working, the mother doesn’t notice the
dust building up and air quality degrading rapidly. Some of the Zooids
measure the air composition at regular intervals, to help monitor the air
quality in the house. As the Zooids detect increasing amounts of dust
in the air, several Zooids bring a respirator mask within reach by the
mother’s toolbox. Meanwhile, another Zooid draws a sign in the dust
on the floor, to create an additional representation of the poor quality
of the air. As the mother finishes drilling, she notices the sign drawn by
the Zooid in the dust and sees the respirator, and feels that her nose is
starting to be itchy. Now aware of the poor quality of the air, she opens
the window, put on the respirator and starts cleaning the room.
Saturday evening. Once dinner is over and the kids have put all the
dishes away into the dishwasher, the Zooids remind the family that the
compost bin is almost full and that it’s trash pickup day tomorrow. The
daughter, seeing the level of her contribution towards household chores
as indicated by the Zooids, decides to take the compost out. As she is
heading out with the compost bin, the Zooids near the garbage light up
to indicate that it too is almost full. The daughter decides to take care
of both the compost and the garbage at the same time.
Meanwhile, the older son looks at the physicalizations near the TV
to choose the family’s entertainment for the evening. He looks at the
representations of which shows have been watched recently, how much
each family member enjoyed it, how adventurous the family is feeling
about what to watch, etc. He does not consider his younger brother’s
preferences tonight as the Zooids on the family schedule show that the
younger son is away at a sleepover at his friend Ben’s house.
Saturday night. After the father comes back from putting the kids to
bed, both parents decide to take a closer look at the recent biometric
measurements of their newborn daughter displayed on the ambient
visualization in the living room (see Fig. 2). The recent evolution of
the baby’s weight, height, and other statistics indicate to the parents
that the baby is very healthy and follows the national growth charts.
Checking the house before bed, the father finds that the compost
and trash have been emptied, as indicated by the Zooids lights. The
Zooids do one last final checkup of the house, and they confirm that all

Saturday morning. The father decides to cook his specialty for the
weekend family breakfast, an omelette. Looking at the physicalizations
on the refrigerator of what is available in the fridge, he knows how
many eggs there are, what vegetables he can incorporate into the dish,
which ingredients are going bad and need to be used right away, etc..
Having access to all this information, he is able to serve up a delectable
dish whilst using urgent ingredients. Zooids keep track of what has
been used and what ought to be replenished, given the family habits
when grocery shopping. As the children prepare to leave the kitchen
to get dressed up, the father looks at the weather forecast for the day.
He likes to keep a group of Zooids on the side of the fridge to display
the forecast in the kitchen (see Fig. 1). As these indicate a sunny and
warm day, the father tells his children to wear T-shirts and hats.

the windows and doors are locked, the family dog is safe and sound in
his little house in the garden, and the electronic appliances are turned
off. The father climbs into bed next to his wife, ready to discuss the
fantastic movie his older son had played for the family tonight.
By making information more available through multiplying and diversifying representations of data within the space, embedded personal
physicalizations can increase people’s cognition and awareness of their
surroundings, and trigger reflection and associations of ideas.
2.2

Personal Physicalizations for Collaboration and Decision Making

In our most recent paper [12], we presented a scenario depicting how
physicalizations composed of Zooids can support collaboration and
decision-making. In this scenario (see Fig. 3), a family is planning
their future summer holidays. They want to find a place that meets the
expectations of each member of the family. To do this, they physicalize
a dataset containing information about numerous attractive places. They
can then explore the multiple dimensions of the dataset and isolate
places of agreement, based on the result of queries. With this method,
the whole family collaborates and participates in the decision-making
process; they discuss and compromise to settle on a location. They
also create an ambient physicalization that they attach to the kitchen
wall. This physicalization represents the price of the flight for a few
locations the family is interested in. Placing this on the kitchen wall
allows them to keep track of the evolution of the projected costs, as they
aim at buying tickets when prices would reach the threshold matching
the budget set by the parents.
With this scenario, we conjecture that the tangible nature of the physicalization may better support collaboration by bringing the members of
the family around a physicalization and providing them with a common
ground, i.e., Reference Space [2]. This allows richer communication
and thus can improve collaboration. Jansen et al. [8] speculate that
physicalizations may better engage the audience, fostering our perception, skills, and experience to interact with the physical world [7].
Based on existing work in the fields of education and tangible user
interfaces, studies have shown that physicality offers cognitive help
using, for instance, epistemic actions [3, 10]. We believe that these
benefits can contribute to better supported collaborations.

C HALLENGES

The space of embedded personal physicalizations is ripe for exploration.
Not only is it an almost untouched area of research, but it can also
potentially impact and empower every person, promote the widespread
use of visualization, and help to develop visualization literacy. Many
challenges emerge when designing embedded personal physicalizations.
In this section we describe the most salient of these challenges.
3.1

Adapting Infovis Priorities in the Home

The golden rules of visualization most likely do not apply in a home,
which is a personal environment. Most information visualization guidelines are about faithfully and accurately presenting data, for fast and
efficient perception of trends, values, and relations. In a personal
context, we argue that other factors such as aesthetics, relatability, persistence, natural integration into the home, and curiosity-triggering, are
likely to be more important.
Embedded personal physicalizations are very well suited to this
context that does not necessarily require accurate representations of
data. Embedded personal physicalizations are also particularly appropriate for monitoring data streams in real-time, acting as constant
reminders, and becoming ambient visualizations, as we are used to
living surrounded by physical, tangible objects.
In addition, information visualization research often assumes that
people interacting with visualizations are fully dedicated to the act of
decoding, analyzing, and interpreting data. This situation is less likely
to be the case in personal environments. Under such conditions, where
people split their attention and distribute their cognition in the physical
spaces they live in, what makes a visualization effective is yet to be
determined.

Fig. 3. The family uses a dynamic composite physicalization system [12]
to support collaboration and decision making.

In this particular context, we as a community need to question the
efficiency and appropriateness of the visual encodings we employ to
convey data. Some guidelines may not apply to embedded personal
physicalizations. And perhaps some encodings that we quickly discard
when designing visualizations are particularly relevant to embedded
personal physicalizations. Rankings of encodings are based on perceptual studies that measure how fast and accurate people are at reading
and comparing data values. But there is a growing discussion about
how these rankings and guidelines can matter less, or even be meaningless, when factors like privacy, subjectivity, emotions and sharing of
personal stories are more important than fast and accurate perception
of data (e.g., [1, 4, 17, 23]).
3.2

Blending Streaming and Historical Physicalizations

Embedded personal physicalizations based on technologies such as
swarm and robotic interfaces are particularly well-suited to providing
real-time visualizations of streaming data, gathering insights, enhancing
human awareness, and aiding collaborative decision-making activities.
However, because they are more “things” than “stuff” [11], they are
also ill-suited to visualizing large amounts or aggregations of data.
On one hand, highly dynamic visualizations that are well-suited to
visualizing streaming data are likely to help people react immediately
based on some data updates. On the other hand, visualizations that do
not update much and are better-suited to comparisons and historical
analysis, are likely to help people reflect and plan longer-term actions.
This tradeoff between highly dynamic, token-based visualizations
and scalable, aggregated visualizations is not specific to physicalizations. For example, Visual Sedimentation [6] explores the challenge of
transitioning from digital data tokens to aggregates of data over time,
using the metaphor of the natural process sedimentation process. However, the challenge appears to be bigger in the physical world, subject
to more constraints than its digital counterpart. While strategies for
smoothly transforming token-based visualizations into aggregated ones
are relatively easy to design, explore, and study in the digital world,
this poses a difficulty in the physical world.
One of the main challenges in enabling embedded personal physicalizations to support both awareness insights, as well as reflective and
analytical insights, is to blend visualizations of streaming data with
visualizations of aggregated data. While the former provides real-time
feedback, the latter delivers historical information for comparison and
analysis, helping self-reflection and behaviour changes.

3.3 Evaluating Physicalization in the Wild
As technologies become more and more available, we see more systems
emerging as research prototypes or potential products. Yet, we need to
understand their usability and benefits in personal usage contexts. Very
much like the Tenison Road project [21], longitudinal studies can help
refine the new systems and most importantly, understand how they can
inform and alter our behavior.
3.4 Requirements
The following are a few requirements that we deem important for an
ideal embedded personal physicalization system from both implementation and design perspectives. Additional requirements may be identified
with further development of implementation specifics.
Versatility. Embedded personal physicalizations should remain
setup-agnostic, i.e., they should not need a specific or localized setup
to work. In personal spaces, one may want to be able to re-arrange
and move things around freely, bring objects to the living room or to a
friend’s house. The system should be flexible to be context independent.
Scalability. The size of the personal physicalizations should remain
a design variable, to accommodate different spaces as well as different
resolutions.
Dynamicity and Interactivity. Embedded personal physicalizations should be dynamic to react to real-time feeds of data. Furthermore,
interactions should be supported to react to users’ manipulations, allowing collocated input and output.
Trust. When entering private and intimate spaces, users need to
create a trust relationship with the system. To this end, the personal
physicalization system should provide transparency regarding the data
collection and processing, and ensure ethics in the design.
Non-Intrusiveness and Privacy. Embedded personal physicalizations should be designed with reflection and relatability in mind.
Personal physicalizations are not recommendation systems, and thus
should not provide users with conclusions, but rather with all the element to allow them to make their own decisions. Consequently, embedded personal physicalizations should not disrupt or trouble everyday
life. One should be able to hide the physicalizations, or obscure what
they represent.
3.5 Feasibility
To our knowledge, only few currently available technologies allow
to implement embedded personal physicalizations meeting the aforementioned requirements of versatility, scalability and interactivity.
Zooids [11] are one of these technologies that support embedded personal physicalizations. As a result, the physicalizations presented in
the scenarios in Sect. 2 are largely inspired by Zooids and what they
are capable of, as well as potential future improvements. Yet, Zooids
show clear limitations that prevent creating embedded personal physicalizations as presented in the scenarios. In particular, restrictions due
to tracking range and cost restrain the extent to which these scenarios
can be readily implemented. Other technological approaches such as
ubiquitous robotics [9] as well as shape changing interfaces [18] could
allow for rich and diverse embedded personal physicalizations.
4 C ONCLUSION
Embedded personal physicalizations have the potential to help people
leverage the massive amounts of personal data that they collect in their
everyday lives. They offer dynamic, actuated physical representations
of data that can help families gain awareness insights, participate in
collective decision-making activities, reflect on their behaviors, and
change their habits. While embedded personal physicalizations offer
some unique advantages, they also come with difficult challenges to
tackle. We provide an initial discussion of these challenges as well as a
first list of requirements for designing embedded personal physicalizations at home.
