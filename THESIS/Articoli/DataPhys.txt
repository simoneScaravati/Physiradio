ABSTRACT

Physical representations of data have existed for thousands
of years. Yet it is now that advances in digital fabrication,
actuated tangible interfaces, and shape-changing displays are
spurring an emerging area of research that we call Data Physicalization. It aims to help people explore, understand, and
communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations. We call these representations physicalizations,
analogously to visualizations – their purely visual counterpart.
In this article, we go beyond the focused research questions
addressed so far by delineating the research area, synthesizing
its open challenges, and laying out a research agenda.

More than 7000 years ago, the Sumerians used clay tokens
to represent quantitative data well before inventing written
language [59]. The Incas never even developed a writing system but relied on Quipus – complex assemblies of knotted

ropes – for data storage and retrieval [3]. Scientists in the 19th
century used physical representations as essential teaching and
research aids [15] for organic chemistry and thermodynamics.
Today, designers are crafting data sculptures to convey meaning and emotion in data [79]. All such physical representations
help people think about, explore, and share data.
Similarly, for centuries people have been developing visualizations for flat surfaces, such as maps or genealogies printed
on papyrus, paper, tapestries, and now computer screens. Yet,
recent and anticipated technological advances in digital fabrication, tangible user interfaces [63], shape displays [54], and
programmable matter [30] are radically changing the fidelity
and flexibility with which data can be made physical (see
Figure 1) while decreasing the cost of doing so. We see an
unprecedented opportunity to create new forms of physical
representations – they will be self-reconfigurable, freely manipulable, and will eventually support data analysis tasks as
complex as performed on today’s desktop computers.
This article identifies Data Physicalization as an emerging
research area that uses physical data representations to help
people explore and communicate data. So far work in this area
has been scattered and has focused on specific questions, thus
an overview is needed to establish this area and to advance its
research. We illustrate the current and future potential of physicalizations through usage scenarios and discuss their possible
benefits. We clarify how this area relates to other domains
such as Visualization [10] and Tangible User Interfaces [31]
by illustrating its focus on data analysis (versus other forms
of interface usage) in a physical form (versus visual presentation only). We then synthesize a research agenda for Data
Physicalization detailing challenges such as how to encode
data physically, how to support interaction, what enabling
technologies are needed, and how to evaluate physicalizations.

WHAT ARE DATA PHYSICALIZATIONS?

We propose that:
A data physicalization (or simply physicalization) is a
physical artifact whose geometry or material properties
encode data.
For instance, the physicalization in Figure 1–left is a wooden
three-dimensional model of Mexico City where height encodes
population density. The photo in the middle shows a physicalization of similar data, but dynamic. Here, the physicalization
is used as a detail view to explore a larger information space
displayed on an adjacent large screen [70]. While the photo on
the right is a technology demonstration, it shows the potential
to use free-floating particles to encode data [61].
The above definition should be taken as a working definition.
A similar definition has been given for physical visualizations [34], and the terms can be used interchangeably. We
prefer physicalization as it aligns with neologisms such as
sonification and haptification [56] without favoring one specific sense. By extension, we also refer to physicalization as
the process of producing physicalizations (to physicalize is
to give data physical shape), and as a research area. These
three meanings are consistent with the way visualization is
currently informally employed by the Visualization community. However, the lack of an explicit distinction can easily
generate confusions that we wish to avoid here. To reinforce
this we use capitalization when referring to research areas.
Other Examples of Physicalizations

The idea of turning data into physical artifacts is not new, with
many physicalizations already in everyday use [15]. Today’s
physicalizations are mostly static, but can offer potential perceptual, cognitive, and communicative value that neither paper
nor computer displays may be able to offer.
An example of current use of physicalizations is shown
in Figure 2–left, where Kevin Quinn, a chief engineer at
General Motors, uses a custom Lego-based board to oversee and update problems and progress in production lines
(tinyurl.com/mwilson2012). To him, two important benefits of
this physicalization are the constant availability of information
and the motivational factor for his engineers who like to see
the progress of their work publicly reflected on the board.
Medical doctor and public speaker Hans Rosling (Figure 2–
right) uses physical representations to emphasize his messages
during his presentations (tinyurl.com/roslingBox). He uses
physicalizations for their communicative and perhaps persuasive power. In the shown example, he discusses the divide
between the world’s rich (blue box) and poor (green boxes)
and illustrates possible effects of policy changes by moving
these boxes between piles. His physicalizations are useful
and effective in communicating information which individuals
may find difficult to comprehend due to unfamiliar magnitudes
and scales. It can also carry a shock value.
Future Usage Scenarios For Physicalizations

To further illustrate the potential of data physicalizations, we
provide three usage scenarios which are fictional and to a large
extent ignore current technological limitations.

Rosling during a public talk (right, image c TED).
Science Museum

A visitor to a museum walks into a room which describes the
earth’s changes in climate. She picks up stones that physicalize the change of temperatures on Earth backwards in time.
She can get a good sense of the differences between ice ages
and hotter periods – but when she gets to the volcanic beginnings and the stones quickly heat up, she drops them. At the
hurricane diorama, miniature hurricanes of the past 50 years
move over a map of North America covered in dense fog, with
only the eyes of the storms allowing a peak inside. The visitor
places her hands over two of the eyes, and the differences in
pressure give her the sensation of the intensity of the hurricanes at their peak. She reaches into the eye of the stronger
hurricane and feels a strong drag on her hand when it crosses
the eyewall. She can easily judge how devastating it was.
Explaining Complex Systems

A government analyst developed an improved multi-variate
model that predicts the economic position of her country. During a meeting, she physicalizes past and predicted time-series
data for indicators such as GDP, income tax rates, and unemployment, into line charts (physicalized as wires). Uncertainties in the system are illustrated by wires expanding into cones
that cover the ranges of plausible values. To illustrate the
requirements for ensuring a 2% growth in GDP, the analyst deforms and compresses the GDP cone and shows the effect on
tax revenue. Once she has reached a realistic growth objective,
the dynamic physicalization is frozen and static 3D printed
models are created for the policy makers in the audience.
Neurosurgical Planning

A neurosurgeon scans the brain of a patient who suffers from
an asymptomatic tumor. He physicalizes the data into a
visually and haptically realistic brain model made of programmable matter (i.e., microscopic particles that can dynamically re-arrange themselves and change their properties [30]).
With a caress, he makes the brain semi-translucent to reveal
the tumor’s localization. He then takes a scalpel and cuts the
brain into slices. He lays the slices side-by-side to identify and
mark the tumor’s tendrils. He then stacks the slices again and
they re-assemble back into a monolithic object. With a poking
gesture, he then turns the brain into a 3D connectivity graph to
reveal functional correlations between brain regions. He pulls
dense clusters of links apart to see them more clearly. After
this sequence of explorations he gains the insight that the tumor may soon affect important perceptual and cognitive brain
functions and recommends immediate scheduling of surgery.

We see many possible benefits of physicalization on the perceptual, cognitive, and societal levels. We discuss some of
them here. Currently, however, the empirical literature offers
scant evidence about the merits and possible limitations of
data physicalizations. Consequently, this discussion draws
upon the insights from other fields. We later identify the lack
of empirical studies as a major element of the research agenda
for Data Physicalization. For now, we note that these potential benefits need to be traded off against the costs of data
physicalizations, in particular the cost of creating them.

work hand-in-hand. For example, stroking a surface produces
sounds that nuance tactile information on texture [9, Chap 7].
A rich repertoire of gestures is available for gathering both
visual and non-visual information. Lateral hand motions can
reveal an object’s texture, holding it unsupported can reveal its
weight, while following contours can reveal the details of its
shape [38]. Informative sounds can also be produced by knocking an object or by scratching its surface [4, 11]. These are
all “built-in interaction techniques” and none of them need to
be explicitly implemented and documented. Such interactions
are hard to emulate with output devices (e.g., [35]).

Leveraging our Perceptual Exploration Skills

Making Data Accessible

THE BENEFITS OF DATA PHYSICALIZATION

Humans have evolved a highly complex sensorimotor system
that allows them to efficiently extract information from the
physical world [9]. We explain why physicalizations can tap
into these skills more deeply than classical computer setups.
Active Perception: A major benefit of physicalizations is that
they better exploit our active perception skills. Perception has
evolved as an active process, that is, it strongly relies on motor
control [20]. For example, a physical object like a hand-sized
physicalization can be visually inspected by turning it around,
by moving it closer, or by taking it apart. A large-scale physicalization can be explored by walking around. In contrast,
on-screen visualizations need to explicitly support active perception by coupling input with output devices, that is, by being
“interactive”, possibly introducing usability issues. For example, visual exploration of large information spaces typically
requires navigation tools such as pan-and-zoom. Although
powerful, these tools are often inconsistent across applications
and constantly need to be rediscovered and learned.
Depth Perception: Another benefit of physicalizations is their
better leverage of our spatial perception skills. Since physical
objects give rich cues of shape and volume, 3D data can be perceived with less effort and more accuracy on physicalizations
than on computer displays – even stereoscopic ones [34].
Non-visual Senses: While vision is a dominant sense, it is not
the only way by which we explore the world. As our earlier
scenarios illustrated, touching a physical object can reveal a
whole set of additional information such as texture, stiffness,
temperature, and weight [27] – it becomes a haptic display of
information [38]. Hearing also provides information on object
properties [11]. Even smell or taste can can signal warning or
invitation. All senses can participate in information gathering
and they each have unique characteristics that can be leveraged
by physicalizations. Touch, for example, requires close contact
with the object, meaning that materials can be manipulated
to influence our emotional states [27]. Physicalizations can
take advantage of these additional sensory channels to convey
a larger range of meanings than a simple visual display.
Intermodal Perception: The idea of conveying data to several senses has been around (e.g., [26,42,56]) but has typically
followed a multimodal approach, where multiple output devices address the senses separately. In contrast, data physicalization follows an intermodal approach [64] that guarantees
cohesive and realistic multisensory experiences. When inspecting physical objects, perceptual senses are tightly coupled and

Since physicalizations can address non-visual senses, they
can make data analysis more accessible to visually-impaired
people. Traditional approaches use raised paper to convey
maps and charts [12, 16], or cork boards with pins and rubber
bands to teach mathematical functions [41]. Novel interactive systems are trying to improve these techniques [41, 42]
but often follow a multimodal approach and thus do not fully
leverage our perceptual exploration skills. With physicalizations, visually-impaired data analysts may be able to explore
data through the geometry and material properties of data artifacts in more ways than possible with currently established
techniques. For instance, they could explore physicalizations
with both hands to gain an overview, possibly using tactile
pre-attentive cues [10] to identify interesting features that they
could then explore in detail. At the same time, such physicalizations could be designed to remain compatible with visual
exploration and thereby foster collaboration between sighted
and unsighted analysts.
Cognitive Benefits

We expect physicalizations to benefit cognition and learning. Physical representations have been widely used in classrooms, for example, to teach basic mathematics [19] and chemistry [77]. A large body of evidence from educational psychology suggests that manipulable physical representations
facilitate understanding and learning [48]. Part of this research
is motivated by the embodied cognition thesis, according to
which cognition is supported by the body and the physical
world [7]. Similar arguments have been made for the benefits
of tangible user interfaces [48, 63]. Although the artifacts used
in classrooms and educational psychology studies are typically not physicalizations (i.e., they do not convey data), we
assume that some of their cognitive and educational benefits
will transfer to physicalizations. Given the key role of physical
manipulation in learning, we believe this to be especially true
for rearrangeable and interactive physicalizations [33].
Bringing Data into the Real World

Apart from their perceptual and cognitive benefits, physicalizations allow individuals and groups to relate to data in new ways.
The Tangible User Interface community has already pointed
out that embedding physical artifacts in the space around us
offers possibilities beyond those of virtual objects [28]. In
comparison to screen-based visualizations, physicalization
can similarly offer to bring data to many more places and
aspects of our social lives. In particular, since physicalizations
can be anywhere and are always “on”, they can be used as

ambient data displays and support casual visualization [53].
Furthermore, data is increasingly present in museums and art
galleries in the form of data sculptures [15], that is, physicalizations created by designers and artists whose purpose is
to communicate meaning and elicit reflection on data [43].
Meanwhile, more and more makers and fabrication enthusiasts physicalize data for sharing or for personal purposes [68].
Even fashion is being impacted, as people are already wearing
personal data in the form of jewelery (e.g., www.meshu.io).
Engaging People

An emerging challenge in information visualization – particularly in the area of data journalism – is to engage large
audiences with data [14]. There is anecdotal evidence that
physicalizations may aid individuals in engaging with and
communicating information to others more effectively than
with digital representations. Our earlier example showed Hans
Rosling using physicalizations to communicate world statistics
(see Figure 2–right). The growing popularity of data physicalizations in many societal domains indicates a strong potential
for fostering public engagement. This popularity suggests that
data physicalizations pique interest, and this interest could in
turn be leveraged to have people spend more time and effort
exploring and understanding important and complex data.
Summary

We have put forward several arguments suggesting that physicalizations can be beneficial. We do not expect them to be
beneficial in all situations, but the number of favorable situations will undoubtedly increase as technology advances. The
increasing popularity of physicalizations provides another argument for studying them, irrespective of their practical merits
and drawbacks. Flat surfaces – such as paper and later computer screens – have long been the primary media for visualization, but this is rapidly changing. While data physicalization
is becoming part of our society, scientific research is lagging
behind. The TUI community is only starting to consider data
exploration scenarios [18], while the Visualization community
only recently started to explore physical designs [75] and carry
out studies on physicalizations [34, 66].
DATA PHYSICALIZATION AS A RESEARCH AREA

So far we covered data physicalizations as artifacts. We discussed why such artifacts can be beneficial, and hinted at how
current and future technology will allow us to create more
powerful interactive data physicalizations.
We now discuss Data Physicalization as a research area. We
show that it is not simply a subset of existing fields, but a
new research area that opens up new research questions and
challenges beyond what existing fields are concerned with.
We propose to think of Data Physicalization as:
a research area that examines how computer-supported,
physical representations of data (i.e., physicalizations),
can support cognition, communication, learning, problem
solving, and decision making.
Data Physicalization relates to two broad topics: (i) the support
of data analysis through visualization and (ii) the support of
human-computer interaction through physical objects.

Data Physicalization and Visualization

Data Physicalization is related to the fields of Information
Visualization (InfoVis) and Scientific Visualization (SciVis).
Since the two fields are most often separated by the type of data
they address [44], we use Visualization as an umbrella term
for “the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of data to amplify cognition” [10]. This definition
includes four aspects closely related to Data Physicalization: a
focus on external representations, computing, interaction, and
the ultimate goal of enhancing humans’ cognitive abilities to
deal with data. One key difference is that Data Physicalization
does not explicitly focus on the visual channel but instead
attempts to tap into perceptual exploration skills more broadly.
Another important difference is that Data Physicalization excludes systems that convey data solely through flat visual
displays, although it does include hybrid setups such as deformable visual displays [1, 17, 58, 65], provided the geometry
or material properties of the display surface encode data. Consistent with our definition of data physicalizations, the focus is
on the physicality of data representation, not on the physicality
of interaction. Thus most setups involving multi-touch and
large display surfaces are not the focus of Data Physicalization, despite the “physicality” of direct touch interaction and
locomotion in space. However, the field is clearly concerned
with how touch – both as input and sensory modality – and
locomotion can support data analysis with physicalizations.
While Data Physicalization is concerned with physicalizations
whose construction or actuation is computer-supported, interaction with physicalizations can also take place in the physical
world without computer assistance [34]. Furthermore, handmade physicalizations of which many historical examples
exist [3, 15, 59] may not involve computers at all, but are relevant to Data Physicalization when they can inform and inspire
the design of modern, computer-supported physicalizations.
Data Physicalization and TUI

The area of Tangible User Interfaces (TUI) studies interactive systems that “give physical form to digital information,
employing physical artifacts both as representations and controls for computational media” [71]. While this view clearly
emphasizes the physical representation of information, the
physical representations themselves are generally not meant
for data exploration and analysis tasks. Several TUI systems
have been developed for such tasks, but they typically use
physical objects as controls, while the data itself is visualized
on a screen [72] or top-projected [49, 73]. Although controls
can encode information through their physical arrangement,
this information entirely originates from the user and is not
meant to be explored to gain insights as in Figure 2–left. Thus
it does not constitute data in the Visualization sense [10].
Overall, there is large overlap between TUI and Data Physicalization, though they differ in focus. While both necessarily
involve input and output and share many concerns, the former
mostly focuses on information input and manipulation tasks
(with output being used to assist in the task) while the latter
mostly focuses on information output and exploration tasks
(with input being used to assist in the task). The area of TUI
has been remarkably productive in addressing technological

and theoretical challenges, and its work will be important both
to implement data physicalizations and inform their design.
Conversely, simple data exploration scenarios have started to
be used to illustrate actuated TUIs [70], suggesting that the
idea of data physicalization is making its way into the community and may well become a major drive for TUI research.

Three main challenges are involved in creating perceptually
effective physical designs to convey digital data: (a) understanding the design space of physical data representations,
(b) understanding the perceptual effectiveness of different approaches, and (c) finding out how to implement these designs.

Examples of Data Physicalization Research

Charting the Design Space – Physical Variables

Several research papers have already started to address questions raised by Data Physicalization. Early on, Vande Moere
and colleagues pointed out the potential of data sculptures as
a medium and the need to study them more deeply [43, 75, 79].
Later, several papers were published in Visualization and HCI
venues that investigate empirical [34], design [67,69], and conceptual [32, 33, 75, 79] questions regarding physicalizations,
as well as specific application domains [68]. However, the
physicalizations investigated are static and none of this work
involves novel input and output technologies. Conversely, as
far as we know, none of the work on new user interface technologies explicitly addresses Data Physicalization questions.
ENABLING TECHNOLOGIES

The area of Data Physicalization both depends heavily on available technologies, and can contribute to shaping the emergence
of future technologies. Research has already demonstrated
the process for composing and creating one-off static physicalizations using fabrication technologies [68, 69]. Dynamic
physicalizations, on the other hand, require computer-driven
control of physical geometry or of material properties.
A range of technologies for controlling physical geometry have
been explored in the area of shape-changing interfaces [54,58],
many of which could be used to implement dynamic data physicalizations. Several systems offer discretized shape control
through arrays of motorized bars [18, 52], winch-actuated
wires [15], or tiltable tiles [1]. Complex dynamic geometries
can be also created by assembling actuated modules [30, 60].
Alternatively, continuous shape deformation can be achieved
through, e.g., pneumatic or hydraulic actuation [17, 78], or
shape-memory alloys [58]. Microrobotics can also be used to
position multiple physical objects on a 2D plane [21, 45, 57],
while free 3D positioning through levitation is currently being
researched [39, 61]. Physical geometry encoding can be complemented with color encoding through the use of deformable
visual displays [47, 65], sets of actuated visual displays [1],
or projection mapping [5]. Finally, technologies also exist
for dynamically controlling material properties such as stiffness [17,35,54], weight [46], or transparency [17], all of which
can be used as additional dimensions to encode data.
While many of the above systems are bulky and only allow
limited control over geometry and material properties, they lay
the foundation for the promise of programmable matter [30].
RESEARCH AGENDA

Data Physicalization brings with it many research questions
and challenges regarding the design, implementation, and evaluation of physicalizations. We split up open research questions
into four main themes: (i) how to convey data effectively, (ii)
how to employ animation and support interaction, (iii) covering specific applications, and (iv) evaluation methodologies.

Designing Physical Data Representations

Data Physicalization and Visualization share the problem of
finding suitable transformations from digital data to humanreadable representations. The standard visual encoding process in Visualization maps each data point to a visual mark
(i.e., a graphical primitive) and each data attribute to a visual
variable (e.g., position, area, length, or hue) [13]. If we want
to create physicalizations that are meant to be readable – as
opposed to purely artistic data sculptures [36] – we need a
similarly principled way of encoding data.
Researchers have begun to address this challenge by applying
2D and 3D visual encodings to physicalizations [69]. However,
classical visual encodings largely ignore the multisensory nature of physical exploration that we previously highlighted as
a benefit. Visual variables can be complemented with haptic
variables such as resistance, friction, and temperature [22].
Roberts and Walker suggested the identification and use of
such variables for each of our five senses [56]. However,
considering senses separately does not fully capture the way
information is encoded and accessed in the physical world [64].
For example, a smooth surface like glass or metal tends to be
highly reflective, feels cold when touched, and silent when
caressed. All these cues together participate in the perception
of a single integrated physical property, “smoothness”.
We argue that instead of studying individual sensory (e.g., visual or haptic) variables, it is necessary to study how they can
be combined in physicalizations. We propose to call physical properties such as smoothness, hardness, or sponginess,
physical variables. Physical variables are not inherently haptic, nor visual. They are also typically perceived actively,
through exploratory actions involving hand, head, and body
movements [20, 33]. Identifying, exploring, and classifying
physical variables is a research challenge that will be key to
understanding the design space of data physicalizations.
Understanding what is Effective

When engaging in the design of physicalizations, one needs
to know the design space of physical variables but also how
effective they are at encoding and communicating data.
Perceptual studies in Visualization [13] have resulted in guidelines on how visual variables are best employed. For example,
length as a visual variable is known to be perceptually effective at conveying quantitative values, while color hue is
not [13]. Although initially developed for flat media, we can
use many of these guidelines as a starting point for designing
physicalizations. Yet, work on visualizations for wall-sized
displays [6] cautions against a direct transfer. It showed that
certain viewing angles change the effectiveness of visual variables and suggests that different effects may be found as well
for data physicalizations. Work has also suggested that 3D
spatial encodings are perceived more effectively when made
physical than when shown on a screen [34].

In addition to studying how the use of visual variables transfers
to non-flat spatial encodings, guidance is needed for conveying data to non-visual senses. Besides informal guidelines for
haptic variables [22], we are unaware of any guideline for using physical variables. Data Physicalization needs to develop
empirical guidelines similarly to those in Visualization, and
consider similar questions such as: what are the just-noticeable
differences that a physical variable can convey? Can it convey
quantitative, ordinal, or nominal data best? Are there physical
variables that can be perceived pre-attentively? Importantly,
studies need to assume an active – rather than a fixed and passive – observer [20]. Also, the many interactions between the
senses that physical variables address, as well as the interactions between the variables themselves, likely make their study
very challenging compared to the study of visual variables.
Besides perceptual efficiency, discoverability and recognizability also need to be considered. While the presence of
visual cues is easy to detect, the presence of physical cues like
weight may not be. Physicalizations should be designed so
that users can quickly identify which physical variables convey
information, and how. This requires understanding to what
extent people’s experience in perceiving the physical world
can be transferred to physicalizations, and how much requires
explicit learning. Data physicalization researchers may need
to be involved in developing new data encoding conventions,
as well as helping promote physicalization literacy.
There are other aspects of data physicalization design besides
the choice of appropriate physical encodings. For example
physical size: a large physicalization such as in Figure 1–left
can convey large amounts of data and be explored collaboratively. However, it cannot be manipulated and examined like
a hand-sized physicalization [34]. Thus the effects of form
factor and size will also need to be better understood.
Finally, the potential support for engagement previously discussed will also need to be studied. It is unclear which physical
representations would contribute most to an engaging experience. Processing fluency – the ease with which an observer
can decode an object – has also been shown to affect people’s
preferences [55]. Thus other qualities of physical variables
need to be studied besides their perceptual effectiveness.
Implementation Challenges

Digital fabrication technologies greatly facilitated the process
of prototyping and creating static physicalizations [68, 69] but
even the most elaborate digital fabrication machines available
today have not been built with data physicalization in mind.
Multi-material 3D printers can interleave different source materials to gain some form of control over properties such as
color, opacity, or deformability, but the range of materials
available is still very limited [25, 47]. Much more research is
needed before machines can accurately render physical variables such as thermal conductivity, weight, smell, or taste.
A further challenge is to ensure reproduction fidelity of physical variables across different machines. Materials also need to
be chosen such that the variable they encode does not “run out”
or depletes due to repeated user interactions. This requires
careful consideration, as certain properties like temperature
or deformation can change the value of the encoded variable

after successive use. One way of addressing physical variable
depletion is through active physicalizations, where an external
energy source can be used to maintain a physical variable such
as temperature at a desired value.
Active physicalizations can address other hard problems of
physicalization implementation, such as free positioning in 3D
space. While an on-screen visualization can have free-floating
objects, physicalizations are subject to gravity. Technologies
have been explored to address this, such as the use of magnetic
fields [39], bubbles [62], or acoustic levitation [61] (see Figure
1–right). However, fine control over 3D geometry is hard and
no technology exists yet that can successfully physicalize data
encodings as simple as 3D scatterplots.
Finally, prototyping and building physicalizations involve complex workflows, ranging from laborious and low-fidelity manual crafting to custom programming (less laborious but requires expertise) to fully automatic (lower entry requirements
but little control over the design) [69]. Thus, one challenge
is to characterize possible fabrication workflows and classify
them as to their benefits and drawbacks, including how fast
physicalizations can be created or replicated, how accurate
they are, how expensive the required material is, their environmental impact, and which skills are required to create them.
Supporting Animation and Interactivity

While physical encodings are important to convey a dataset
effectively, building dynamic data physicalizations can help
support not only reusability across datasets, but also a wider
range of analytical and communication tasks. Here, we discuss
two main challenges: (a) how to design effective dynamic
physicalizations, and (b) how to implement them.
Designing Dynamic Physicalizations

So far we considered a fixed dataset with a fixed physical representation. Most on-screen visualization systems are however
dynamic, and are therefore able to visually reflect (1) changes
in datasets, (2) changes in data operations such as filtering
and aggregation, (3) change from one data representation to
another, (4) changes in visualization settings such as color
scales and sorting order, and (5) view transformations such
as pan, zoom, or rotate [33]. These operations can be either
triggered by the system (they are animated) or by the user
(they are interactive). Much research is needed on how to
support similar features on data physicalizations.
Previous work on animated visualizations examined how to
turn abrupt visual changes into animated transitions [24]. Although we expect most dynamic physicalizations to support
animated transitions by design, it remains a challenge to design them such that they appropriately convey the changes to
the observer. In particular, it remains unknown whether optimal settings for timing apply to animations in 3D space and
animations of other physical variables, and what the perceptual
limits of concurrent changes in these variables are.
Designing interaction with physicalizations is likely even more
challenging. As discussed before, a key characteristic of physicalizations is their built-in support for interaction techniques
that generally need to be explicitly implemented on regular displays. A hand-held 3D physicalization can be manually turned

around. Modular physicalizations can be disassembled, reassembled, rearranged, aligned, thus already covering a range
of analytical tasks [33, 67]. We call such interactions physical interactions to contrast them with what we call synthetic
interactions requiring sensing, actuation, and computation.
The primary research challenge in designing effective interactive physicalizations is to find how to best combine physical
with synthetic interactions. For example, with modular or
malleable physicalization designs based on LEGOs or clay, a
range of tasks can be manually accomplished through physical
interaction, including updating datasets (see Figure 2–left),
filtering data, or even changing their representation. At the
same time, computer assistance is clearly desirable in many
cases to accomplish repetitive or computational tasks.
Designing synthetic interaction techniques for physicalizations
may require readapting – or more likely reinventing – interactive visualization. For example, should we support dynamic
filtering through physical range sliders [72], or through more
physical, direct manipulation gestures [18]? Some functionalities may not map to any manipulative gesture. Filtering
on non-encoded dimensions, for example, will likely require
alternative interaction mechanisms, such as symbolic gestures
or instruments. Regardless, Data Physicalization will need to
study ways of smoothly integrating synthetic with physical
interaction, while avoiding “Midas Touch” issues common in
gesture-based interfaces [40]. A key question is how much automation is necessary, and whether automation can be used in
a way that preserves the cognitive benefits offered by physical
object manipulation.
As with physical encodings, recognizability and discoverability of interactions are important. While synthetic interactions
that rely on direct manipulation or familiar controls can convey
their function through physical affordances (e.g., a handle or
a switch), not all interaction styles can be easily expressed
with affordances. Examples include symbolic and/or mid-air
gestures [18]. The most effective interaction designs for data
exploration also likely depend on factors such as the type of
data, the size of the physicalization, and the number of users.
Implementation Challenges

While we often speak of computer displays as being dynamic
displays, we want physicalizations to be more generally reconfigurable. Reconfigurability is required to switch datasets,
to physicalize dynamic data (e.g., from a streaming source),
or to get different perspectives on the same dataset. Recall
that these operations can be either automatically triggered
by the system (animation), or invoked by the user, either via
sensing and actuation (synthetic interaction) or through purely
physical manipulation (physical interaction).
Reconfigurability is required to implement rich physical interactions. For example, a modular 3D bar chart supports
reordering [32], and a LEGO-based physicalization could support even more tasks. However, limited reconfigurability can
be desirable. Information as to which states and operations are
meaningful can be conveyed as physical constraints, by adding
mechanical features such as attachments [69] or bindings [67].
Physical constraints have been already used in TUIs [72] but
largely remain to be explored for physicalizations.

Actuated physicalizations can switch physical states without
human intervention. Actuation provides support for animation,
and once combined with sensing, for synthetic interaction. A
key element to consider from the implementation perspective
is the degree of self-reconfigurability of hardware technologies,
as well as the speed with which the devices can reconfigure
themselves. Self-reconfiguration taxonomies [54, 58] are key
to better understanding to what extent different technologies
can support data physicalization. For example, 2.5D shape displays [18] can support 3D bar charts of a certain size as well as
solid terrain visualizations, but not 3D scatterplots. Although
such devices are ultra-fast and can support slick interactions
once combined with sensing, support for other physical representations requires a higher degree of self-reconfigurability.
The technological complexity required is high, and much more
research is needed to achieve full spatial flexibility [30].
Novel technologies are also needed to dynamically convey
variables other than geometry. Prototypes exist that can dynamically control softness [17, 54] or weight [46], but more
work is needed before we can “actuate” a range of physical
variables such as reflectivity, porosity, rugosity or taste. The
ultimate physical display that can dynamically control not
only its shape and colors, but also its material properties still
belongs to science-fiction, but is an exciting goal to pursue.
More work is also needed to better understand the practical
trade-offs between different technologies, especially between
digital fabrication and actuated devices. Despite its many
benefits, actuation only supports temporal multiplexing, that
is, showing a single dataset or view of a dataset over time. In
contrast, many passive physicalizations (analogously to paper
print-outs) can be easily duplicated, produced in different
versions, arranged side-by-side, and explored. As passive
physical objects they are both permanent and disposable, two
properties that are lost when switching to actuated technology.
Finally, over-arching the above technological challenges is the
importance of making the value of physicalizations greater
than their construction cost (e.g., time, money) [74]. Only
when this benefit is achieved can physicalizations become
mainstream. The cost of producing data physicalizations can
be reduced with appropriate tools that aid in their construction,
both for static [69] and for dynamic physicalizations.
Application-Specific Challenges

Even though physicalizations promise many possible benefits,
we expect them to apply differently depending on application
scenarios. Thus, we need to identify the application areas that
can draw immediate benefit in relation to the required cost
and effort of creating them, and to understand the trade-offs
involved [74]. Gaining such an understanding may also help
develop physicalizations that target large audiences [14].
Consider education as an example. As mentioned earlier, physical artifacts have been shown to facilitate learning [19, 48].
Physicalizations could further help students understand data
from topics such as meteorology, history, physics, or chemistry [15, 77], or help them learn about data representations [75]. They could support a way of learning that is not
purely auditory or visual. Students could share and compare
data objects, and even author their own [29, 75]. Yet we need

to understand how such physicalizations should be designed
to best support collaborative learning activities. It is also an
open question to which extent physicalization literacy has
to be taught to students before they can begin to understand
physical encodings less familiar than 3D bar charts.
Using a physicalization will likely not remain a solitary activity [23]. Physical objects can easily be shared as long as
collaborators are co-located [68], but in many cases people
work over a distance. With current visualization tools, we can
create snapshots to share by email or on paper, or to show
during talks. Static physicalizations could be similarly shared
through fabrication instructions, or dynamic physicalizations
could be remotely synchronized. Many challenges are involved in identifying and implementing appropriate solutions.
Evaluation-Specific Challenges

Evaluating physicalizations is both important and difficult. On
a methodological level, Data Physicalization shares challenges
with HCI and Visualization on how to conduct evaluations.
Given the focus on data representation, many of the evaluation
issues are shared by the Visualization community [37, 50, 74].
A pending challenge is to find appropriate ways of studying
how people engage in data exploration when no clear task
is defined [10]. Another concerns the choice of criteria for
assessing the merits of data representations that go beyond
pure time and error metrics. For example, the benefits of the
physicalizations used by Rosling (Figure 2–right) likely lie in
their pedagogical and persuasive power. Other criteria relevant
to physicalizations include the insights gained from interacting
with them [51], the extent to which they promote engagement
and behavior change, their memorability [8], and the affective
responses they elicit [26]. Taking inspiration from work on
visualization evaluation scenarios [37], it also seems important to explore methodologies for understanding how people
reason, collaborate and communicate with physicalizations.
In terms of research methods, comparative evaluation is of
importance – in particular to empirically establish the benefits
of physicalizations. A difficulty lies in the proper phrasing of
research questions and choice of experimental manipulations.
It is important to identify a fair alternative presentation method
(or modality) as a baseline of comparison. Regular computer
displays are an important baseline, but others include paper
and ink, whiteboards, or advanced computer displays such
as stereoscopic or volumetric displays. All these baselines
need to be tested before we can claim to have strong formal
evidence for the merits of physicalization.
It is also crucial, yet difficult, to only manipulate the presentation modality in order to avoid experimental bias. Data
encodings should be kept the same or similar across modality
conditions for comparisons to be informative [34]. Support
for interaction should also be kept as similar as possible. For
instance, it would be unfair to compare a static physical visualization with an on-screen visualization system augmented
with rich and powerful interaction techniques. Technological
advances in actuated physicalizations will make it possible to
support similar interaction functionality, but keeping interaction styles comparable across presentation modalities while
balancing ecological validity will remain a challenge.

Another example of a potential confound is physical size. It is
already known that display size can have an effect on data exploration efficiency [2]. Therefore, when evaluating the effects
of physicality, physical size has to be kept the same for the
comparison to be fair, e.g., wall-sized on-screen visualizations
need to be compared to room-sized physicalizations.
Finally, the issues of exploring, evaluating, and implementing
physicalizations all are linked and we need new methods to
address them concurrently. For example, how can we investigate a range of synthetic interactions without being subject to
current technical limitations? One possibility is to use proxy
technologies [32], for instance, building static physicalizations
for gesture elicitation studies [76] to inform the design of
synthetic interactions with future actuated physicalizations.
CONCLUSION

Data Physicalization is an emerging area of research that examines how computer-supported, physical renditions of data
can support cognition, communication, learning, problem solving, and decision making. It is related to and bridges traditional fields such as Visualization and Tangible User Interfaces
through its combined focus on data exploration and analysis
with physical data representations, we call physicalizations.
We outlined many possible benefits of physicalizations in
use and multiple research challenges and opportunities that
remain to be addressed. The goal of this paper is to open the
discussion about Data Physicalization as a research area, by
providing a first working definition of physicalization artifacts
and an initial proposition of the area’s research focus.
Data Physicalization is a particularly exciting research area as
many questions remain unanswered and much can be learned
from related disciplines. Visualization researchers, for example, can find novel contexts to apply their knowledge on the
design of data representations, psychologists can contribute
methodologies and studies for understanding how physical interactions influence cognition, hardware enthusiasts can work
on novel ways to implement powerful shape-changing dynamic physicalizations, and Tangible and Human-Computer
Interaction researchers can contribute knowledge on how to
best design and implement interactions for physical data representations. There also remain many fruitful application
domains to be explored for both serious data exploration with
physicalizations as well as more casual use. Data Physicalization research is truly at its beginning and researchers now
have the great opportunity to shape and influence it.
With this paper, we hope to inspire the creation of a community
around research on Data Physicalization that will begin to
address the outlined as well as new and emerging challenges
and opportunities. We hope the outcome will be exciting
examples of how our thinking, learning, problem solving, or
communication can be enriched with data physicalizations.
