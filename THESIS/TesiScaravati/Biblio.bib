  abstract     = {Internet of things (IoT) devices and sensor kits have the po-
tential to democratize the access, use, and appropriation of
data. Despite the increased availability of low cost sensors,
most of the produced data is ‘black box’ in nature: users of-
ten do not know how to access or interpret data. We propose
a ‘human-data design’ approach in which end-users are given
tools to create, share, and use data through tangible and phys-
ical visualizations. This paper introduces Physikit, a system
designed to allow users to explore and engage with environ-
mental data through physical ambient visualizations. We re-
port on the design and implementation of Physikit, and pre-
sent a two-week field study which showed that participants
got an increased sense of the meaning of data, embellished
and appropriated the basic visualizations to make them blend
into their homes, and used the visualizations as a probe for
community engagement and social behavior.},

simple—in that the skills required to build and manipulate the
visualizations are akin to kindergarten play; it is expressive—
in that one can build within the constraints of the chosen environment, and it also supports dynamics — in that these con-
structed visualizations can be rebuilt and adjusted. We describe the conceptual components and processes underlying
constructive visualization, and present real-world examples
to illustrate the utility of this approach. The constructive visualization approach builds on our inherent understanding and
experience with physical building blocks, offering a model
that enables non-experts to create entirely novel visualizations, and to engage with datasets in a manner that would not
have otherwise been possible.},

We argue that direct involvement in such digital fabrication activities can help people invest meaning into artefacts and facilitate social interaction and reflection upon their activities, while encouraging practitioners to incorporate new forms into their own work. On this basis, we
reconsider digital fabrication within data translation activities as situated along an extended ‘trajectory of use’ in which reflective, meaningful ‘data-things’ can be created.},

typical advantages of both digital and physical reality, and that distinct categories of phygital can be recognized based on: 1) the level of physical affordance;
and 2) in how far the technology is integrated into the physical reality. The paper also opens the discussion about the potential challenges and concerns which
future explorations, scientific research and real-world applications of phygital
heritage probably will encounter.},

  title    = {Towards a Framework for Dynamic Data Physicalisation},
  abstract = {Advanced data visualisation techniques enable the exploration and analysis of large datasets. Recently, there is the
emerging field of data physicalisation, where data is represented in physical space (e.g. via physical models) and can no longer only
be explored visually, but also by making use of other senses such as touch. Most existing data physicalisation solutions are static
and cannot be dynamically updated based on a user’s interaction. Our goal is to develop a framework for new forms of dynamic data
physicalisation in order to support an interactive exploration and analysis of datasets. Based on a study of the design space for dynamic
data physicalisation, we are therefore working on a grammar for representing the fundamental physical operations and interactions that
can be applied to the underlying data. Our envisioned extensible data physicalisation framework will enable the rapid prototyping of
dynamic data physicalisations and thereby support researchers who want to experiment with new combinations of physical variables or
output devices for dynamic data physicalisation as well as designers and application developers who are interested in the development
of innovative dynamic data physicalisation solutions.},

  abstract     = {The goal of an external representation of abstract data is to provide insights and convey information about the structure of the underlying data, therefore helping people execute tasks
and solve problems more effectively. Apart from the popular and well-studied digital visualization of abstract data there are other scarcely studied perceptual channels to represent data
such as taste, sound or haptic. My thesis focuses on the latter and explores in which ways
human knowledge and ability to sense and interact with the physical non-digital world can
be used to enhance the way in which people analyze and explore abstract data. Emerging
technological progress in digital fabrication allow an easy, fast and inexpensive production of
physical objects. Machines such as laser cutters and 3D printers enable an accurate fabrication of physical visualizations with different form factors as well as materials. This creates,
for the first time, the opportunity to study the potential of physical visualizations in a broad
range.
The thesis starts with the description of six prototypes of physical visualizations from static
examples to digitally augmented variations to interactive artifacts. Based on these explorations, three promising areas of potential for physical visualizations were identified and
investigated in more detail: perception & memorability, communication & collaboration,
and motivation & self-reflection.
The results of two studies in the area of information recall showed that participants who used
a physical bar chart retained more information compared to the digital counterpart. Particularly facts about maximum and minimum values were be remembered more efficiently, when
they were perceived from a physical visualization.
Two explorative studies dealt with the potential of physical visualizations regarding communication and collaboration. The observations revealed the importance on the design and
aesthetic of physical visualizations and indicated a great potential for their utilization by audiences with less interest in technology. The results also exposed the current limitations of
physical visualizations, especially in contrast to their well-researched digital counterparts.
In the area of motivation we present the design and evaluation of the Activity Sculptures
project. We conducted a field study, in which we investigated physical visualizations of
personal running activity. It was discovered that these sculptures generated curiosity and
experimentation regarding the personal running behavior as well as evoked social dynamics
such as discussions and competition.
Based on the findings of the aforementioned studies this thesis concludes with two theoretical contributions on the design and potential of physical visualizations. On the one hand, it
proposes a conceptual framework for material representations of personal data by describing
a production and consumption lens. The goal is to encourage artists and designers working
in the field of personal informatics to harness the interactive capabilities afforded by digital
fabrication and the potential of material representations. On the other hand we give a first
classification and performance rating of physical variables including 14 dimensions grouped into four categories. This complements the undertaking of providing researchers and designers with guidance and inspiration to uncover alternative strategies for representing data
physically and building effective physical visualizations.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {The home environment is a complex design
space, especially when it has multiple inhabitants. As
such, the home presents challenges for the design of
smart products. Householders may be different ages
and have differing interests, needs, and attitudes
towards technology. We pursued a research-through-
design study with family households to envision
and ‘co-create’ the future of data-enabled artifacts
for their homes. We have iteratively developed
domestic research artefacts for these households
that are open, data-enabled, physical visualisations.
These artefacts - called Domestic Widgets - are
customisable in their design and functionality
throughout their lifespan. The development process
highlights design challenges for sustained co-creation
and the leveraging of household creativity in (co-
creation) research toolkits. These include the need
to allow and inspire iterative customization, the
need to accommodate changing roles within the
home ecology, and the aim that such design should
be inclusive for all family members (irrespective of
age and technical proficiency), whilst maintaining
a role and purpose in the home. We invite the RTD
community to critically discuss our, and other,
open and iterative end-user designs for sustained
co-creation. By presenting unbuilt and interactive
pre-built Domestic Widgets, we interactively foster
engagement with practises of sustained co-creation.},

  note     = {tesi},
  abstract = {In contemporary society, data representation is an important and essential part of many aspects of our daily lives. This thesis aims to contribute to our understanding on how people experience data and what role representational modality plays in the process of perception and interpretation. This research is grounded in phenomenology - I align my theoretical exploration to ideas and concepts from philosophical phenomenology, while also respecting the essence of a phenomenological approach in the choice and application of methods. Alongside offering a rich description of people’s experience of data representation, the key contributions I claim transcend four areas: theory, methods, design, and empirical findings. From a theoretical perspective, besides describing a phenomenology of human-data relations, I define, for the first time, multisensory data representation and establish a design space for the study of this class of representation. In relation to methodologies, I describe and deploy two methods to investigate different aspects of data experience. I blend the Repertory Grid technique with a focus group session and show how this adaption can be used to elicit rich design relevant insight. I also introduce the Elicitation Interview technique as a method for gathering detailed and precise accounts of human experience. Furthermore, I describe for the first time, how this technique can be used to elicit accounts of experience with data. My contribution to design relates to the creation of a series of bespoke data-driven artefacts, as well as describing an approach to design that I call Design Probes, which allows researchers to focus their enquiry on specific design features. To answer the research questions I set out in this thesis, I report on a series of empirical studies that used the aforementioned methods. The findings of these studies show, for instance, how certain representational modalities cause us to have heightened awareness of our body, some are more difficult to interpret than others, some rely heavily on
instinct and each of them solicit us to reference external events during the process of interpretation. I conclude that a phenomenology of human-data relations show how representational modality affects the way we experience data, it also shows how this experience unfolds and it offers insight into particular moments such as the formation of meaning.},

data physicalizations can play in enhancing STEM
learning with young people. As objects that by their
very nature embody and allow the manipulation of

traditional learning materials. In this paper we present
the motivation and long-term aims of the research

date and current studies being undertaken as part of
this research project. Furthermore, we present a vision
of the future directions our research will take over the

development of a series of data physicalizations for use
in the teaching and learning of STEM subjects in
secondary schools.}

abstract={Playing appropriate music when watching images can make the images vivid and bring people into their intrinsic world. In this paper, we propose to musicalize images based on their emotions. Most of previous works on image emotion analysis mainly used elements-of-art based low-level visual features, which are vulnerable to the arrangements of elements. Here we propose to extract visual features, inspired by the concept of principles-of-art, to recognize image emotions. To enrich the descriptive power, a dimensional perspective is introduced to emotion modeling. Experiments on the IAPS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for emotion regression. The music in MST dataset with approximate emotions to the recognized image emotions is selected to musicalize these images. The user study results show its effectiveness and popularity of the image musicalization method.},

  Abstract                 = {Network booting is widely used today: for thin-client computing, cluster computing, operating system installation and context switching in classrooms (i.e., for exams or different lessons). Currently available netboot protocols are the “trivial file transfer protocol” (TFTP) and “hypertext transfer protocol” (HTTP).
When a group of machines need to simultaneously boot, the boot server becomes a bottleneck and it is very easy to reach the server network capacity, thus grinding the whole system to a halt.
P2P network booting could relieve the server burden and some solution already “exists”, but they are either too complicated, very O.S. specific or even “described in a paper but unavailable”...
This paper proposes a Free Software BitTorrent based two-phase downloading system, implemented in a less-than-a-hundred-lines script achieving an almost flat boot time with respect to the number of nodes booting together.},

  Abstract                 = {The author has taught computer science (Programming 101 and Operating Systems 101)
for about fifteen years. He introduced the use of a student-collaborated
wiki website for his courses about ten years ago. Then, three years ago,
he also began extensively using a collaborative editor (Gobby) in classroom, to let
students actively participate during lessons.
This paper describes the author's course ``workflow'', summarizes tools
(wiki and collaborative editor) functionalities, collects some
context pattern and tries to draw a few conclusions (lessons learned)
about the course methodology.},

  Abstract                 = {We live in a society shaped by information and
communication technologies, a continuous interplay
between what happens in the physical world and what
happens online. This inevitably extends the citizenship
concept which becomes digital, where rights and obligations
are properly declined to meet technology opportunities.
These opportunities, however, challenge the very idea of
citizenship and the exercise of underlying rights. The
authors, along with Leonardo Sonnante, proposed a
layerization called “The rainbow of digital citizenship rights”
[De Cindio et al., 2012] to slice all aspects of digital
citizenship in conceptual levels. The framework consists of
abstraction layers spanning from basic network access up to
the highest “right to active involvement in policy-making.”
This article describes the framework first application. The
authors, with their students (“Digital Citizenship and
Technocivism” course) used it to analyze the “Public
consultation on the fundamental principles of the Internet”
promoted by the italian Ministry of Education.},

  abstract  = {L’esplosione del mercato legato alla telefonia mobile, all’automazione, la domotica, ai sistemi di infotainment e guida automatica, alla progettazione di droni e stampanti 3D hanno portato alla ribalta l’interesse per le tecnologie “embedded”. Negli ultimi anni vi è stato un progressivo aumento nella domanda di competenze in questo settore, sia in ambito professionale/industriale sia per le comunità di appassionati e principianti.
Questo testo offre un percorso didattico per coloro che hanno già competenze informatiche di base e vogliono iniziare un percorso multidisciplinare di introduzione ai sistemi embedded. Si inizia con le conoscenze basilari di elettronica ed hardware per poi passare alle nozioni per muovere i primi passi dal punto di vista del software, in modo semplice, pratico e sintetico.},

  abstract  = {Abstract During the second half of the twentieth century pollution became a relevant problem, but after the seventies many governments began legislating against emissions. From then on, air pollution decreased as new technologies replaced older ones and now transportation, both private and public, is no longer the main source of pollution in modern countries (it still is in third world areas). Today urban trafficper se is the main problem. The pollution traffic component being relegated in the background, many governments and local administrations address the “congestion factor” by introducing regulations to reduce private traffic, considered the main source of congestion: access tolls and (public transport/car pools) dedicated lanes and odd measures such as narrowing lanes (and/or reducing their number), lowering speed limits, reducing parking availability, etc. Geolocation and road navigation technologies, combined with widespread mobile connectivity infrastructures have enabled researchers to study the evolution of traffic at a great depth. To the extent that some vendor, namely TomTom, uses collected customer navigators’ data to publish annual reports - the “TomTom Traffic Index” - about the state of congestion in major cities around the world. One proposed solution to congestion or, better, to the underusage of private vehicles, is the so called “carsharing”, i.e., pools of vehicles to be rented for short periods of time (minutes, hours), usually at higher costs (per day) than standard car rental prices. In many urban areas, such as Milan, where the authors live, measures against congestion are combinedly applied, e.g., tolls to enter a particular area, carsharing (with access to the paying area included), dedicated lanes, ban for certain types (older ones) of vehicles. Carsharing vendors “publish” (not entirely/easily accessible) data about the state of their vehicle pool... Can this data be used to analyze these services’ effect, efficiency, usefulness, social cost, etc.? The authors scraped carsharing vendors’ websites for a year, made this huge amount of data uniform, fed it into a mongodb database and then “played” with queries and graphed results. An interesting finding is that even on the carsharing pool a “lung effect” (people moving-in in the morning, moving-out in the evening) is evident, i.e., the common notion that carsharing is not for commuters can be argued. Another interesting behaviour is the evening peak usage, i.e., probably, caused by people using carsharing instead of taxicabs to go out at night (leisure). Moreover, the data show that vehicle usage (the total number of “busy” vehicles at any time) never goes beyond 70%, i.e., there is always a 30% pool of “free” vehicles. Throughout the paper interesting statistical data and graphs will be shown and discussed.},

This paper presents a classification of these state-of-the-art tools, and describes and compares them. The rationale behind the different approaches is presented. Some challenges that the approaches and tools described could face are also pointed out.},

  Abstract                 = {How would you like to study at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) for free? It has been nearly six years since MIT first announced their MIT OpenCourseWare (OCW) program. More recently, MIT announced that the OCW program, a free and open educational resource (OER) for educators, students, and self-learners around the world, is online and will be completed by 2008. The OCW provides open access to course materials for up to 1,550 MIT courses, representing 34 departments and all five MIT schools. The goal is to include materials from all MIT courses by next year. MIT provides just one of the 10 open source educational success stories detailed below. Open source and open access resources have changed how colleges, organizations, instructors, and prospective students use software, operating systems and online documents for educational purposes. And, in most cases, each success story also has served as a springboard to create more open source projects.},
