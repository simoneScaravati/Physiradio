#Unity App

**Win/Linux and Mac Os Standalone software developed totally not exported just like the Android version.**

To run the program:

Windows: just double-click the .exe file

Linux: make the .x86_64 file as executable (On Ubuntu: Right click the file, Choose 'Properties', Go to the 'Permissions' tab, Tick 'Allow executing this file as a program',  Close the dialog.)

Mac OS X : if the Mac doesn't run the .app file:
	 First reach at same folder at which your mac build exist. Then within terminal program execute this link of code:  chmod a+x SomeApp.app/Contents/MacOS/*

Android: Install the .apk file on your smartphone. Google may ask you to trust third party software, please trust me :)
