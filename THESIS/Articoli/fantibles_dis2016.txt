Rahul is a big crickett fan and todayy he is watchinng a cricket
match between Indiaa and Bangladdesh on TV. Beeing a true
supporrter of his natiional team, hee is all dressedd up in the
Indian team jersey (see Figure 1.a). As the match is
unfoldiing, Rahul is getting exciteed and emotioonal on his
team’ss performance. He is cheeringg for every ‘6’ scored and
wicket taken by his team. Buut he is also feeeling sad to
every w
miss oout on the expperience of ‘beeing there in tthe crowd’
where everyone is chanting, chheering and hhaving fun
togetheer. Now to feeel connected with other co-sppectators of
the saame match, hhe starts tweeeting his opiinions and
emotioons about the m
match (see Figuure 1.b).
The abbove scenario illustrates a tyypical examplle of home
viewinng of a crickett match withinn the Asia-paccific region
where Cricket has a devoted fann following [88,45]. Such
crickett fans show inncredible passioon towards theeir favorite

items include team jerseys, signed picture frames, sports
equipment, trophies and also things that fans associate with
the sporting event such as match tickets and captured
photographs from the event [20]. These memorabilia enable
fans to remember enduring battles between the teams and
how their support and cheering contributed to the winning
outcome.

interesting patterns and linguistic features that prompted
emotional response among sports fans on social media.
Some works have also looked at creating novel
visualizations to represent tweet data of the sports fans
onscreen. For example, Kamvar and Harris [24] used
different color particles to imitate emotions of fans on a
common plane, while Kempter et al. [26] proposed an
EmotionWatch, to display different categories of emotions.
The majority of the existing explorations on visualizing
individual’s tweets are mainly onscreen, except for the
work called Emoto [10], which got us thinking towards a
tangible souvenir and its potential to support visualization
of tweets. Emoto is a public art display that showcases
tweet sentiments during the 2012 Olympic games.

However, despite the demand of sports memorabilia [7,14],
the current exploration on designing sports memorabilia is
limited [49]. These memorabilia as found in sports heritage
museums and endorsed merchandise offer a rather arbitrary
view on the sports. For instance, most sports memorabilia
embody a generic design that attain to objective facts and
moments of historical significance such as victories, broken
records and personal milestones [15,30,40]. However, their
design does not fully capture the subjective experiences and
emotional rollercoasters of witnessing a sports match. As a
result, they miss out on being a true representative of the
sporting event as it unfolded in time [30]. Connerton [6]
further argues that momentous events like iconic sports
matches are experienced and remembered differently by
each individual fan. He calls such an experience ‘private
nostalgia’ that originates from the personal memory of the
event and is different from the ‘collective nostalgia’ of the
event. Unfortunately, existing works around sports
nostalgia rarely emphasize and discuss the private nostalgia
of a fan, which we think is a missed opportunity. Frow [15]
and Snyder [40] also fear that the commoditization of
collective sports memory as observed in current
memorabilia, incurs a danger of only the collective views
becoming the dominant narrative of the social history of
sports, which in turn could lead to loss of individual
memories of the sporting event. The aim of this work is
therefore to capture and support the private nostalgia in the
design of sports memorabilia, which thankfully with
today’s technologies we are beginning to explore.

Research opportunity

Existing works highlight the importance of social media as
a platform for fans to express their emotions and to feel
closer to other fans and the game itself. If the role of social
media is to support the dreams of fans to get closer to the
sport, players and fans alike, the role of a souvenir is to
preserve such special moments for the future. Thus, the
overlap of social media and memorabilia can offer new
opportunities of recreating memories by translating social
media interactions and moments into a tangible form.
Incorporating personal data into memorabilia can add a new
layer of personality by expanding its context to social
dimensions, and potentially could also serve as a
visualization platform to get an abstract summary of the
game. This research takes into account the current
popularity of digital fabrication coupled with the existing
knowledge of affordances of physical visualization [23, 27,
43], which makes fabrication of physical artifacts more
accessible. By situating digital fabrication within the
context of TV sports viewing experiences, this research also
opens up an exciting new design space.
DESIGNING FANTIBLES

Fantibles is a personalized sports memorabilia that
embodies the subjective passionate experience of sports
viewing in a tangible form. Fantibles capitalizes on the
trajectory of the individual’s tweets and the progression of
the sports event in real time to create a unique 3D printed
souvenir. As such, Fantibles utilizes two data sets: sports
statistics and social media streams. The sports statistics
include the essential information (or highlights) of a given
sporting event, while the social media stream incorporates
spectator engagement levels during the event. These two
data sets are transformed into separate 3D printed models:
Sportoms and Fantoms that interlock with each other.
Before describing these models, we first explain the
rationale behind some of our design decisions.

Use of social media during sports events

The rise of social media allows fans to not only follow their
favorite players and sports on social media but also to
participate in conversation with like-minded fans [22,
36,38]. Twitter, for example, is often used as a backchannel
to share and observe commentary and opinion about an
ongoing TV sporting event [22], where the first screen is
the television broadcast of the event while the second
screen is a smartphone or a laptop used to monitor and
express opinions about the event. In the past, the interaction
between fan and athletes was mostly one-sided, where only
the few fortunate fans getting an opportunity to interact
with favorite athletes through the cursory of autograph
signing [38]. Athletes and sports management authorities
have also acknowledged the role of social media to create
positive exposure among fans [38]. For example,
Philadelphia Wings of the National Lacrosse League put
players’ Twitter handles on the backs of their jerseys [36].
Kim et al. [28] has done a comprehensive analysis of the
tweets during the 2014 FIFA world cup in order to identify

Choosing Cricket

We choose Cricket because of its wide popularity in the
Asia Pacific region with a huge fan base on social media
platforms [8,45]. For instance, a recent survey [45]
indicated that 89% of Twitter users in India are cricket fans.
In the current prototype, we opted for the One Day

tensionn in terms of how much information should be
conveyyed in a tangibble form. Figuure 3 illustratees some of
the eaarlier design ssketches. We discarded these designs
becausse of the invoolved lengthy modeling annd printing
proces ses. Additionaally, these deesigns were reepresenting
multiplle sets of info rmation into oone model, whhich in turn
was maaking the model complex to iinterpret.

IInternational (O

oof Cricket that we incorporateed in the design
n of Fantibles.
C
Cricket is a gam
me played on a large field wiith a bat and baall
bbetween two teeams, each witth 11 players. Each
E
team tak
kes
tuurns to bat in
n order to scorre runs, whilee the other teaam
bbowls. The first team to bat, scores
s
runs and
d sets a target for
f
thhe bowling teaam to achievee. The other teeam then tries to
aachieve this taarget when theey bat. A criccket match is of
m
multiple overs with each over having 6 baall deliveries. A
pplayer, while batting, can sco
ore runs by hittting the ball wiith
hhis bat in the field.
f
If the balll crosses the boundary
b
line of
thhe field then the player geets ‘4 runs’; And if the baall
ccrosses the bou
undary line aeriially (i.e., with
hout touching th
he
ffield before thee boundary linee), then the plaayer is rewarded
w
with ‘6 runs’. Players
P
from the
t bowling teeam can stop th

thhat are difficu
ult to hit and by preventing the ball fro
om
ccrossing the bo
oundary line. Additionally,
A
th
he bowling teaam
ccan also get th
he player out,, which is callled as taking a
‘wicket’ by fo
ollowing the predefined
p
sett of rules (e.g
g.,
ccatching the ball before it touches
t
the fieeld). These ru

aand exciting parts

of the Cricket

T
The idea of useer excitement has always been central to th
he
ssports. Loy reffers to sports as
a "intrinsically
y appealing" an
nd
ssuggests that the feature of "problematic outcomes" in
ssports "lends tension and excitement to

T uncertaintiies in the sportting event creaate
tension and in turn excitemeent among thee spectators. We

thhought of diffferent ways of
dduring a Crick
ket match. Forr instance, onee option was to

skin response durin
ng
thhe game using
g wearable deevices. Howeveer, such a setu
up
ccould have hindered the privaacy and naturaal sports viewin

d for a less obstructive way of

individuall’s

Since tweets arre publicly vissible by defaullt, their usage is
nnot heavily load
ded with privaccy related issuees.

As a reesult, instead oof trying to fit all pieces of innformation
onto oone model, w
we decided to create two innterlocking
modelss, building upoon earlier worrk by Nissen eet al. [35].
The firrst model repreesents the sporrts data while the second
one deescribes the ffan’s emotionss through tweeets. These
modelss individuallyy provide iinformation aabout the
embeddded data suchh as sports andd tweets but w
when joined
togetheer reveal addditional infoormation suchh as the
relationnship betweenn the two. Addditionally, the m
models are
3D priinted using thee color of the w
winning team’’s jersey as
shown in Figure 2. For example, iff India won the match, the
models were priinted in Whitee and Blue collors (colors
two m

of Inddian Cricket teeam’s jersey), whereas if B
won thhe match thenn the models w
were printed iin red and

then w
we consider theeir excitement level during tthat period

to reprresent this in

ves
aas a timeline and consists of

bbars summarizee 100 overs off an ODI crick

eeach bar repressents the time duration
d
of 5 overs (on averag
ge
8 minutes of gaameplay).

The Faantoms emboddies a floral patttern where eaach petal of
this m
model describes the changess in user excitement for
every interval of 5 oovers (Refer F
Figure 4). Thee length of
each ppetal describees the user excitement leevels. For
instancce, a petal of 00mm length ddescribes a ‘low

excitem
ment, while a petal of ‘10m
mm’ length annd ‘20mm’
length describes thhe ‘medium’ and ‘high’ level of
ment. Additionnally, the heighht of each petall is used to
excitem
denotee the frequencyy of tweets durring the given pperiod of 5
overs. Therefore, eacch subsequent tweet within tthe given 5
will raise the height of thee correspondinng petal by
overs w
1mm. T
The Fantoms iis read clockwiise starting from
m the petal
containning a small bubble on onne of its end. However,
unlike Sportoms, Faantoms do not have a fixed number of
petals, rather the pettals are createdd based on thee pattern of
tweets.. By placing thhe Fantoms on top of the Spoortoms, one
can eaasily identify the score aand the chroonology of

Heatheer expressed jjoy while opeening her firstt envelope

the paackage and eveerybody in myy office lookedd over and
were like: ‘whhat’s that? Itt looks really cool and

thoughht was it looks ggood, and I waant to keep it”. Nelson on
the othher hand said, ““I would not peersonally bougght the idea
of sporrts memorabiliia but these moodels made mee rethink as
they aare very goodd representatioons of the gaame, I will
definiteely keep them””.

W
We designed a custom weeb-based systeem that extraccts
tw
weets from the official tw
witter account of the chosen

when a bad decision happened on the ground, or somebody
hits a ‘6’.”

Fantibles in winning team color was appreciated

Tweets were full of emotions

All participants appreciated the fact that the Fantibles
embodied the color of the winning team. Dev was surprised
when he came to know about the colors, “Initially, I did not
think of the color choices. I thought they were random but I
was positively taken aback by the use of winning colors.”
However, Samira and Nelson wanted colors of both the
teams reflected on the Fantibles. Nelson said, “ I don’t
know if it is possible, but it would be great to have half
portion of Fantibles in one team’s color and other half in
another. In that way I can then easily see the battle between
the two teams.”

Participants’ tweets showcased a variety of emotions from
feeling tensed to feeling overjoyed. Surprisingly, most
tweets occurred during crunch situations in the Cricket
match. For example, some of the interesting tweets during
tense situations were, “I am feeling the pressure just by
watching the game, I wonder how the players stand it…”
“Nerve, nerve, nerve... this match is all taking it…” “:D :D
:D :D, Need 6 more big smiles ... [referring to 4 wickets
that have fallen and 6 remaining]”. Besides ‘4’, ‘6’ in the
match, other situations such as players reaching personal
milestones, or breaking records also generated ample
tweets. However, not all tweets were directly related to the
match. Sometimes participants even discussed other things
such as childhood memories. For example, referring to the
drink trolley that typically comes during the break, Shahid
tweeted, “In my childhood, I used to wonder how big this
bottle on the drinks-trolley is.”

Tweets made Fantibles personal and unique

All participants appreciated the use of personal data, their
tweets during the match in the design, and considered it as a
thoughtful addition. Nelson said, “Tweets bring something
new to the world of memorabilia and make them more
personal”. Dev similarly expressed, “because of the tweets,
Fantibles felt more unique and personal to me”.

Physicality of Fantibles facilitated offline display of
emotions

Fantibles offered reflection on self

All participants appreciated how Fantibles are
representatives of their emotions. Rahul said, “The best part
is that through these Fantibles, I can take my feelings
offline and show it to others even after the match is over.”
Shahid, on the other hand, expressed with joy, “Like most
fans, I love to express my opinion, anger, disappointments
and joy during sports. Previously I was expressing myself
vocally and sometimes with the tweets, the only change, I
see here is now I have a physical record of it (by looking at
Fantibles) and that’s nice.”

Using Fantoms and Sportoms in relation to each other,
Heather was delighted to learn about the things that excited
her in the match most, “Looking at this guy (a thicker circle
that denotes runs), it is kind of cool to see, I am more
excited for the runs. I never realized that”. On the other
hand, Shahid said, “Fantibles helped me in remembering
good and bad memories of the match. I like to remember
bad memories, I remembered the argument on Twitter I had
with friends that whenever we win the match or series, we
forget the mistakes we made. We discuss only the victories,
but it is good to remember the mistakes and challenges that
are still to be overcome.”

Abstractness supported public display of emotions

Three participants liked the abstract display of their
excitement levels through Fantoms. Samira said, “Sometime
I put my frustration in very strong way. Those frustrations, I
do not want to be revealed in public. But with these models,
I can now showcase these feelings in an abstract level. No
one can see my words, all they see is high peaks and I think
this much of expression is tolerable in public.”

Fantibles prompted tweeting

After receiving the first set of Fantibles, participants came
to realize how their excitements and tweets gets reflected in
the floral design pattern of Fantoms. They realized that how
they could alter its design by changing their tweeting
behavior. As a consequence, four participants
enthusiastically expressed their emotions in tweets in
subsequent matches. Nelson mentioned, “My first reaction
after receiving the first Fantibles, was to tweet more and to
see how it would turn out in the design.” He further added,
“Although after getting the second and third Fantibles, I
was still excited and the design made much more sense”.
Heather on the other hand was disappointed for not
tweeting more. She wanted her Fantoms with full of peaks.

Abstract design facilitated personal narration to unlock
its meaning

The abstractness of the Fantibles not only concealed their
emotions but also gave participants an opportunity to
narrate their subjective experience of the match to
interested viewers. Heather was thrilled with how the
models depicted her emotions and said, “When my
colleague picked up the souvenir in the office, she said it
was good for decorating. But she didn’t know how to read
it. It made me feel like if the message was encoded only for
me and that I am the only one who can unlock its meaning.”

Interestingly, the increased tweeting during a game did not
cause any distraction to the sports viewing, but rather
tweeting strengthened their commitment towards Cricket.
As Rahul mentioned, “Cricket as you know has a little
break in between the overs, which gives me enough time to
tweet. In that way, I am letting the world know how I feel

Participants wanted to make Fantibles social

Although all participants liked the personal aspect of
Fantibles, they all wished if Fantibles could embed social
elements such as data from their friends. For most, tweeting

890

was a routine activity with which they connect with their
remote friends while watching a cricket match. Samira
mentioned, “When we post our feelings there, it gives us the
feeling of being and watching together.” Heather, on other
hand, wished to incorporate the stadium noise or crowd
thinking about the match within the design. For her, it
would be cool to compare her emotional response with her
friends and other people in the stadium. She further added,
“It would be really great to take these ideas to the stadium
and then record and compare your team and opposition
team’s support over the game.” Nelson remembered about
the soccer stickers that he used to collect during his
childhood, he said, “Fantibles reminds me of completing a
soccer album when we friends used to get together and
change stickers.” He wanted to extend Fantibles to support
similar experience.

an iconic match. If you bring home such a cricket ball that
represent an iconic event or special memory, others might
find it hard to differentiate it from other ordinary cricket
balls as they do not hold the same memory. As such,
memorabilia relate to memories of personal experiences
and require narration from the owner to unveil the story
behind them. In other words, the meaning of the sports
memorabilia is not in the tangible object but is in the mind
of its owner. As Heather experienced, her colleagues
wanted to know how to interpret the Fantibles, and required
her narration to explain the meaning behind large emotional
peaks. This feature provided her with a sense of privacy and
control over information that she wants to share with others.
Layered Sense Making

The player facts and the sports analytics are a core part of
fan’s intellectual engagement with sports. By exploring
individual’s social media contribution, we see a potential of
going beyond the ‘facts and the data’ about sports and an
opportunity to explore other complementary aspects of
sports centered on an individual’s subjective experiences. In
Fantibles, we focused not only on the ‘facts’ and ‘data’
(‘tell-a-tale”) of a Cricket game but we also put an equal
emphasis on individual’s contribution to the game of
Cricket as expressed in their tweets. Earlier studies also
suggest that people find opinions in shortened forms such
as in Twitter easier to understand as opposed to longer
writings in news stories and blogs [3]. However, as per the
nature of social media, the generated tweets embody a
digital format and accessing back key moments from one’s
own tweets or reflecting back upon one’s emotional state
during the match requires browsing and scrolling through
pages of tweets. We note that, although twitter limits a
tweet to 140 chars, there is no limit on how many tweets
one can send during an ongoing sports event.

DISCUSSION

We discuss participants’ responses to Fantibles across four
themes as below.
Self-expression

Twitter supports individuals’ self-expression by allowing
users to create a desirable representation of themselves to
other people through their tweets [4]. Within a sports
context, Twitter supports an individual’s self-expression
and allows them to display their passion towards the sports
through their tweets and offer a way to connect with other
fans. Rinehart [39] highlights the desire of many sports
fans, who want to be ‘players’ themselves, not as to
participate in the sport but rather to make their opinion and
presence count in the sport event as a whole.
Lowenthal [32] writes, “Individual memories convert
public events into idiosyncratic personal experiences”. He
further adds that, “we recall only our own experiences at
first hand and the past we remember is innately our own”.
As such, Fantibles captured an individual’s narrative
(commentary) on sports and reinforced its significance and
meaning for later usage through transforming it into a
tangible souvenir that resonates with the identities of the
sports fan. The use of personal tweets acted as a physical
signature that made the Fantibles authentic. Fantibles
served as a tangible testimony and an official recognition of
being a sports fan. As a result, participants developed an
emotional attachment with the memorabilia. Their public
display in different parts of their home further facilitated
exhibition of one’s devotion to sports, creating an alternate
representation of self [17]. For instance, Shahid took pride
in displaying his Fantibles to his friends and visitors to his
home and it allowed him to share good and bad memories
of the cricket match he passionately witnessed.

The Fantibles through its abstract design offered a quick
way for individuals to see an abstract summary of one’s
tweets (particularly, emotions). Participants welcomed the
tangible aspect of the memorabilia, which takes them away
from the screen. According to Kaplan and Kaplan [25], a
restorative physical environment clears the mind from
unwanted thoughts and provides opportunities for broader
reflection by directing attention to only key aspects. A
sports memorabilia should, therefore, avoid providing too
much information by keeping the data mapping simple and
direct. The memorabilia presents the summary of the sports
along with tweets in a way that can be perceived at a glance
to the fan. Participants also liked the interlocking nature of
the Fantibles, which provided them with the opportunity to
add more layers if the fan wanted to expand meaning. For
example, as a future work on Fantibles, we can add a third
layer of data printed on a piece of paper that displays
textual sports and tweet data. Users can then utilize this
extra layer along with the Fantibles as a navigator to extract
further information as shown in Figure 9.

Van den Hoven [48] wrote about the esoteric qualities of
the tangibles that hold a special meaning for their owner but
can remain obscure for others. In the sports context, a
typical cricket ball can be purchased for 20$ but even the
picture of the same ball gets sold for massive prices if there
is a distinct memory associated with it such as being used in

conneccted with her ffriends throughh Facebook andd how they
enjoy eeach match th eir team playss through chatss as if they
are alll in the same room. We beelieve that inccorporating
intrinsiic spatial and social qualitiees of being a ppart of the
crowd could further eenhance the individual’s sporrts viewing
experieence at home. For instance, Heather highllighted that
the spoorts are often a collective soocial viewing eexperience,
therefoore adding dataa such as her interactions w
with friends
on soccial media or crowd noise ffrom the stadiium would
provid e additional w
ways to relivve and celebrrate shared
memorabilia coould make
memorries. Having ssuch social m
watchiing sports togeether more enjjoyable and coould invite
discusssion even afterr the event has ended. We sugggest using
a moduular interlockinng structure ass practiced in our design
to embbed data from multiple sourcces. For exampple, friends
can sticck their Fantom
ms on top of onne common Spportoms, to
correlaate their excitem
ment levels.

when interlockeed together

We found that the sports

Fantibbles and value them by makking them a ppart of the
home aambience.

A
Ad-hoc Interac
ctions

IIn line with earlier studiees [27, 29, 48],
4
participan
nts
ppreferred a meemorabilia thatt is visible in the
t surroundin
ng,
aand that they can
c interact wiith using their hands to deriv
ve
ffurther meaning
g. Sports mem
morabilia thereffore should hav
ve
aan affordance of ‘place’ as well as ‘usse’. Miller [34]
ddescribed the tendency of maaterial artifactss to disappear in
thhe background
d, which he calls as “humility
y of things”. Ass a
rresult, although
h memorabilia are visible in the surroundin
ng,
thhey are not thee sole focus off attention. Th
herefore, in ord
der
too make them noticeable, meemorabilia sho
ould support ada
hhoc interaction
ns with individ
duals as they move around in
thhe surroundings. For examp
ple, two participants attached
m
magnets to Fantibles
F
and
d then put Fantibles
F
on a
rrefrigerator so that they beecame noticeab
ble in everyday
aactivities. Such
h an approacch supported frequent ad-hoc
innteractions witth Fantibles.

Althouugh we exploreed only one spoort (Cricket) thhrough one
represeentation, we bbelieve this ppaper contribuutes to the
knowleedge of persoonalizing sporrts memorabiliia through
four coonceptual desiggn themes thaat designers cann utilize to
extendd the work to oother sports. Our goal behindd this work
was noot to propose fiinished final deesign; rather w
we aimed to
provokke discussionss and critique around proloonging the
experieence of sporrt events throough reminisccence and
lookingg into tangiblee qualities. To tthis end, this w
work opens
up neew exciting opportunitiess for creatinng sports
memorrabilia throughh the use of personal social m
media. We
hope oour work helpps to drive D
DIS forward inn terms of
design that encomppasses a widee world of spports with
excitinng new technnologies that support the qualitative
