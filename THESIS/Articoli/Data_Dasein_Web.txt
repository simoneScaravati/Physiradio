ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

As I write these words I find myself reflecting on my PhD journey,
from the first email exchange with my supervisor, over many fond
memories travelling across the world attending conferences, to the
endless pages of transcripts and finally to the last few words that I
type here. It’s been fun, exciting, inspirational, exhausting, intriguing,
confusing, satisfying but most of all endlessly rewarding, an assortment of emotions all wrapped up in one bundle of fulfilment. But the
words I wrote would not have been possible without the help and
support of so many people. Firstly, I would like to thank my family,
especially my Mam & Dad who have supported me, not only during
this chapter, but on every page of my life.
I would like to pay special thanks to Uta Hinrichs - one could not
ask for a more creative and hard-working co-author. Also to Claire
Petitmengin for her expert training on the Elicitation interview technique and Val for being a willing volunteer for many practise Elicitation interviews.
I have also been so fortunate to have some really special educators around me for many years. Thanks goes to Angela Mellot, who
taught me not to be scared of creativity while in school, to Kieran
Whitelaw, who opened my mind to the possibilities of design, to Liam
Bannon who introduced me to HCI and of course to the very special
Eva Hornecker. Eva, this work would never have happened without
your support, guidance, advise and many other things that you have
so kindly given me over the last years. Thank you for asking the
hard questions and forcing me to always push harder, I am forever
indebted to you.
Lastly, I started and finished this journey with and because of Julia,
it would not have been possible without your love and never ending
support. Along the way we were joined by our little Fina & Léna, you
are both the sparkling light at the end of a tunnel, two rays of sunshine that never quenches. This work is for you.

ABSTRACT

In contemporary society, data representation is an important and essential part of many aspects of our daily lives. This thesis aims to
contribute to our understanding on how people experience data and
what role representational modality plays in the process of perception and interpretation. This research is grounded in phenomenology - I align my theoretical exploration to ideas and concepts from
philosophical phenomenology, while also respecting the essence of a
phenomenological approach in the choice and application of methods. Alongside offering a rich description of people’s experience of
data representation, the key contributions I claim transcend four areas: theory, methods, design, and empirical findings. From a theoretical perspective, besides describing a phenomenology of human-data
relations, I define, for the first time, multisensory data representation
and establish a design space for the study of this class of representation. In relation to methodologies, I describe and deploy two methods
to investigate different aspects of data experience. I blend the Repertory Grid technique with a focus group session and show how this
adaption can be used to elicit rich design relevant insight. I also introduce the Elicitation Interview technique as a method for gathering
detailed and precise accounts of human experience. Furthermore, I
describe for the first time, how this technique can be used to elicit
accounts of experience with data. My contribution to design relates
to the creation of a series of bespoke data-driven artefacts, as well as
describing an approach to design that I call Design Probes, which allows researchers to focus their enquiry on specific design features. To
answer the research questions I set out in this thesis, I report on a series of empirical studies that used the aforementioned methods. The
findings of these studies show, for instance, how certain representational modalities cause us to have heightened awareness of our body,
some are more difficult to interpret than others, some rely heavily on
instinct and each of them solicit us to reference external events during the process of interpretation. I conclude that a phenomenology of
human-data relations show how representational modality affects the
way we experience data, it also shows how this experience unfolds
and it offers insight into particular moments such as the formation of
meaning.

In der heutigen Gesellschaft sind Datenrepräsentationen ein wichtiger
und wesentlicher Bestandteil vieler Aspekte unseres täglichen Lebens.
Diese Doktorarbeit zielt darauf ab, zu unserem Verständnis beizutragen, wie Menschen Daten erleben und welche Rolle die Modalität
der Repräsentation im Prozess der Wahrnehmung und Interpretation spielt. Diese Forschung basiert auf der Phänomenologie – meine
theoretische Erforschung ist ausgerichtet durch Ideen und Konzepte
der philosophischen Phänomenologie, und berücksichtigt zudem die
Essenz eines phänomenologischen Vorgehens bei der Selektion und
Anwendung von Forschungsmethoden. Zusätzlich zu einer detaillierten Beschreibung der menschlichen Erfahrung von Datenrepräsentationen sind die wichtigsten Beiträge meiner Arbeit die folgenden:
Theorie, Methoden, Design und empirische Resultate. Auf theoretischer Ebene beschreibe ich die Phänomenologie der Daten-Mensch
Beziehung, definiere erstmals den Begriff der multisensoriellen Datenrepräsentation und stelle den Designraum zur Untersuchung dieser
Art von Darstellung auf. Um verschiedene Aspekte der Datenerfahrung
zu untersuchen, wende ich zwei Methoden an, welche ich ausführlich
beschreibe. Ich verknüpfe das ‚Repertory Grid‘ Verfahren mit FokusgruppenSessions und zeige, wie diese Adaption angewendet werden kann um
reiche design-relevante Einsichten zu gewähren. Zusätzlich wende
ich die Elicitation-Interview-Technique an, um detailliert und präzise
menschliche Erfahrung zu erfassen. Weiterhin beschreibe ich erstmals, wie diese Methode genutzt werden kann, um genaue Berichte
der Erfahrung von Daten zu erhalten. Mein Beitrag zum Design besteht
in der Schaffung einer Reihe eigens angefertigter Artefakte sowie der
Beschreibung eines Ansatzes, den ich Design Probes nenne, welche
es Forschern erlaubt, ihre Untersuchung auf spezifische Designmerkmale zu konzentrieren. Um die Forschungsfragen zu beantworten,
die dieser Arbeit zugrunde liegen, berichte ich über eine Reihe von
empirischen Studien, welche die oben genannten Methoden nutzen.
Die Ergebnisse dieser Studien zeigen zum Beispiel an, wie bestimmte
Repräsenationsmodalitäten ein erhöhtes Bewusstsein für den eigenen Körper bewirken. Einige Modalitäten sind schwieriger zu interpretieren als andere, manche werden eher instinktiv interpretiert,
und alle fordern uns dazu auf, während des Interpretationsprozesses
auf externe Ereignisse zu verweisen. Meine Schlussfolgerung ist, dass
eine Phänomenologie der Daten-Mensch Beziehung zeigt, wie die Er-

xi

fahrung von Daten durch die Repräsentationsmodalität beeinflusst
wird, wie diese Erfahrungen sich temporal entfalten und entwickeln,
sowie Einsichten ermöglicht in spezifische Momente, wie die Entstehung von Bedeutung.

INTRODUCTION

In contemporary society, data representation is an important
and essential part of many aspects of our daily lives. Representations in the form of demographic statistics, financial reports, environmental data, economic trends and others are being widely distributed by the media, which compete for people’s attention and comprehension. The recent proliferation of
data representations can be traced back to two key moments
that breathe new life into this field of study – the publications
by the eminent scholar and pamphleteer Edward Tufte, and
the heralding of the era of personal computers. When Tufte’s
book The Visual Display of Quantitative Information was first
published in 1983, it revitalised interest in the representation
of data using visual elements and also revived interest in the
eighteenth-century pioneers in this field [287]. Around the same
time as Tufte’s work was becoming noticed, the personal computer was becoming commonplace at work and in our homes.
This technological advancement offered new opportunities for
lay people to engage with new and novel ways of representing data. This was further enhanced later with the release of
the World Wide Web and more recently with the easy access to
data sets via APIs.
The 1990’s also heralded a period of dramatic change for data
representation; these technology developments paved the way
for the formation of new fields of research, most notable Information Visualisation (InfoVis), which specifically focused on
the study of interactive digital data representations. Shortly after its conception, InfoVis was defined as “the use of computersupported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data
to amplify cognition” [34, p.8]. As the practice and study of
data representation broadened, so did the audience and target
group that these tools were aimed at. No longer was it just
aimed at experts and data analysts, but soon everyday people
were confronted with data representations on a daily basis on
websites, on television, at the museum, the library or other public spaces. While many aspects of data representation evolved
during this period of time, one aspect remained unaltered - the

introduction

vast majority of representation relied exclusively on the visual
modality when representing data, requiring the audience to interpret and gain meaning from the data using only their visual sense. While using the visual modality to represent data
is still the norm for the majority of data representations we
see today, the emergence of research fields, such as: Information Aesthetics [154], Artistic Visualization [300], Data Art [172]
and Casual Visualization [233] have sought to broaden the use
of representation modality (cf. [196] [325]), widen the target
audience (cf. [265] [233], and expose alternative data insight
(cf. [207] [38]).
My research is inspired by these fields of study, and the lines
of enquiry that have emerged from them. It is based on the belief that new insight and meaning can be achieved by representing data beyond the visual modality, which can be touched, felt,
heard, held, or even possessed. Consequently, these data-driven
artefacts act as the embodiment of the data source and capture
the imagination and engage the interpretative and perceptive
power of its audience through both their experiential, tactile or
artistic qualities. An aim of my research is to represent data in a
manner that exposes insight, which may be difficult to uncover
when using traditional methods such as one-dimensional static
graphs and charts. I contend that the use of modalities such
as haptic, tactile, auditory - or any combination of these - to
represent data can facilitate an experience that is significantly
different from when only the visual modality is used.
In validating this, I strive to expose and explore the type of
experience people have with data. I also seek to compare the experience of one representational modality against another, observing how this experience unfolds over time as well as looking at particular episodes of this experience, such as moments
of insight. The approach I take to investigating these experiences is strongly motivated by literature that emphasizes the
felt experience of interaction [180], the postulation of use qualities [165], discourse on hedonics (cf. [93]), affect (cf. [323]), empathy [320], enchantment [181], as well as the re-emergence of
phenomenology within the HCI community, as an approach to
better understand people’s experience of technology [278].
This thesis aims to leverage the theoretical and practical aspects of this work to contribute to our understanding on how

1.1 research question

people experience data and what role representational modality plays in the process of perception and interpretation. Experience, in this context, relates to personal responses to a data
representation, which goes beyond interaction and usability aspects to focus on capturing hedonistic, emotional, and sensory
reactions to the representation as well as personal interpretations, meaning, and opinions that it may trigger.
1.1

research question

When I started my primary research the question that I had
in mind to answer was somewhat simply – How do people
experience data? Following an initial review of the literature,
as well as conducting some early design exercises, this question evolved and extended to three connected questions, which
remained to be the focus of my research from then on, these
questions are:
• How do people experience data?
• What influence does representation modality have on this experience?
• How does it affect the way meaning is formed by the audience?
The first question includes aspects, such as, the unfolding of
this experience overtime and episodes of insight. The second
part should not be read as being focused on one modality, instead I sought to compare the affect different modalities have
on our experience of data. Whereas the third part involves, not
only shedding light on the meaning that it formed from our
experience with data, but also the cognitive activities used during this process. While seeking answers to these questions two
other pertinent questions emerged:
• How do you study people’s experience of data?
• Which methods allow for the capture of precise accounts of experience?
These methodologically focused questions necessitated the
formulation of a coherent research approach, and prioritised
the search for methods that would provide me with the tools
to answer the three aforementioned questions. In the following
I describe this research approach.

introduction

1.2

research approach

I divide the discussion on my approach into the three pillars
of my research: Theory, Methods and Design. I return again
to these pillars in the final chapter of this thesis when describing the key contributions of my work, the majority of which
emanated from these areas.
1.2.1

Theory

While I situate this work in the tradition of HCI, I draw heavily on phenomenological theoretical perspectives on how to
study human-data relations. Phenomenology is concerned with
people’s lived experience of phenomena or as Don Ihde eloquently describes it as an investigation into “the conditions of
what makes things appear as such” [117, p.133]. In the context
of my research, I leverage theories developed in philosophical
phenomenology to explore people’s relationship with data and
to help understand the processes that are involved, such as,
perception, action, and interpretation. In particular I use ideas
and concepts developed by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde.
Commonly cited as the father of modern phenomenology,
Husserl’s reframing of intentionality describes the structure of
an experience as both actional and referential in nature, while
Heidegger’s concepts helps to make sense of temporality and
how we use equipment (in my case data representations). The
work of Merleau-Ponty also focuses on our use of tools but he is
better known for dealing directly with the nature of the human
body and of perception, and finally Ihde’s theory of humantechnology relations is widely cited as a way to account for
the various ways technology mediates people’s experience of
the world. Phenomenology has a long tradition in HCI and has
shaped influential work (cf. [52] [152] [277] [111] [60].
I consider my approach to be similar to many phenomenological oriented approaches in HCI, in so much as I leverage
theories from phenomenology but bracket all pre-suppositions
when studying the phenomenon, which in my case is data.

1.2 research approach

1.2.2

Methods

While phenomenology, from a philosophical perspective, is concerned with the way phenomenon appears to use in our everyday lives, from a methodological perspective, phenomenology
demands a process that emphasizes the unique subjective experiences of people and tries to uncover and describe the internal
meaning structures of lived experience. Working within a phenomenological tradition, studying people’s experience of data
requires empirical grounding in actual lived experience. However, capturing direct human lived experience is notoriously difficult and calls for setting up situations where the essence of an
experience can be grasped or understood by studying episodes
as they are encountered. The two methods that would typically support the capture of lived experiences are observational
studies and interviews; however, these methods have some limitations, such as, for instance, the introduction of post-hoc rationalisation. To overcome this and other issues, I combined
two methodologies that would allow me to capture accounts
on how people construe their experience of objects, people or
events (the Repertory Grid technique) and gather detailed and
precise accounts of human experience (the Elicitation Interview
technique).
The Repertory Grid technique has been used widely in HCI
since the 1980’s, however, in this thesis I present an adaptation
that allows for the capture of rich data in a group setting. On
the other hand, the Elicitation Interview technique has rarely
been used in empirical studies and on only two occasions in
the context of HCI, I therefore describe the key characteristics
of this interview technique and exemplify how it can be applied in an empirical setting to show what types of insights
this technique can bring to the fore.
1.2.3

Design

The final pillar of my research approach that I describe relates
to design. While the theoretical and methodological approach I
followed remained stable since the outset, my design approach
evolved over time. As I have a background in product and interaction design, I commenced with a series of design exercises
that followed a traditional approach, which incorporated iterative phases such as analysis, concept development and syn-

5

introduction

thesis. Following the first design and evaluation experiment, I
recognized that creating complex artefacts impeded me from
focusing on specific aspects that maybe affecting people’s experience of data (such as representational modality). As my research prioritised the examination of representational modality,
and I was more interested in how people experience data rather
than how they used data-driven artefacts, my design approach
evolved to address these specific concerns. What emerged is a
design approach that I call Design Probes. While this is similar to
Research Through Design (RTD) [326], it is unique in so much as
it doesn’t involve an iterative process, which is integral to RTD.
I also consider it to be close in intent to Technology Probes [115],
however, instead of studying the use of one artefact (which is
the procedure followed with technology probes), I design multiple artefacts that possess similar design features but differ in
one aspect (e.g. representational modality). This approach allows me to focus the subsequent evaluation precisely on this
design feature.
1.3

thesis structure

This thesis is divided into three parts: (1) Theory and Design,
(2) Methodologies and Experiments, and (3) Reflection. In Part One
(Theory and Design), I discuss the theoretical and design foundations of my research. I start Chapter 2 by presenting the
philosophical and methodological foundation of my research
approach. I also provide a brief overview of the foundations of
philosophical phenomenology, before focusing on the work of
four important thinkers: Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger,
Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde, whose ideas provide
an important theoretical backdrop to the critique and study of
data experience. I conclude this chapter by discussing the role
phenomenology has played in the field of HCI.
In Chapter 3 (Data Representation and Evaluation), I present
and describe current approaches, techniques, tools, technologies and methods used in the creation and evaluation of data
representations. I first address issues related to representational
modality before highlighting the different domains that are actively engaged in topics related to the study and practice data
representation. I then move on to aspects of evaluation and discuss current research that relates to the type of questions I am
attempting to answer. I conclude by presenting commonly used

1.3 thesis structure

approaches and methodologies that allow for the capture of
people’s experience of data representation.
In Chapter 4 (Data, Design and Dasein), I present a design
exercise and user-study that produced and examined two prototypes that represent scientific data to a casual audience. I
also describe how these prototypes were deployed in a public Space Observatory, where I conducted a series of user studies. I present an analysis of the prototypes through the prism
of philosophical thought by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde, where I apply phenomenological theories and ideas to the exploration of people’s
experience of tangible data representation.
In Chapter 5 (A Design Space for Multisensory Data Representations), I present a systematic analysis of the state-of-the-art
in data representations over the last 150-years. In particular, I
focus on representations that require more than one sensory
channel to fully interpret and understand the data. Drawing on
techniques and theories adapted from Thematic Analysis and
Prototype Theory, I analyse 154 examples of multisensory data
representations to establish a design space along three axes: Use
of modalities, Representation intent and Human-data relations. Following a discussion on the design space, I present key research
challenges that emerged and point out future research topics.
This chapter concludes the theoretical part of my thesis.
In Part Two (Methodologies and Experiments), I introduce two
methods that are used to elicit accounts of experience and present
three studies that exemplifies the use of these methods - in the
context of understanding how people experience data representation. The aim of Chapter 6 (Adapting the Repertory Grid
Technique) is threefold; I first introduce the Repertory Grid technique as method of collecting data on how people construe
their experience of objects, people or events. I then present my
adaptation of the technique, which involves blending it with a
focus group session to allow for the capture of first-hand accounts of experience during the study. Finally, I describe an experiment that was designed to validate and confirm this adaption by comparing two side-by-side Repertory Grid studies (traditional verses adapted).

introduction

Chapter 7 (From Phenomenology to Psycho-Phenomenology) is
dedicated to introducing the Elicitation Interview technique as
a method for gathering detailed and precise accounts of human experience. I show how it can be applied in the context
studying data representation, to help understand how people
experience and interpret representations as part of exploration
and data analysis processes. This chapter also presents a description of the key characteristics of this interview technique
and exemplifies how it can be applied to evaluate static data
representations. This study illustrates what types of insights
this technique can bring to the fore, and presents general evaluation scenarios where the Elicitation Interview technique may
be beneficial and specify what needs to be considered when applying it.
Chapter 8 (Delving Below the Surface) is divided into three
phases, a design phase and two evaluation studies. The two
studies described in this chapter incorporate different methodologies (The Repertory Grid Technique and The Elicitation Interview Technique), and were conducted consecutively. The rationale for employing this approach was to conduct a series of
experiments that allows for the elicitation of accounts of experience at finer levels of granularity. While I will discuss the findings of each of the studies separately, I conclude this chapter by
collating the findings of both studies. This chapter concludes
the methodologies and experiments part of this thesis.
In the final part and chapter of this thesis I reflect upon the
work conducted over the course of my PhD and I revisit the
major points and research questions in this thesis. I summarise
what I have learned and what does this mean for the study and
design of future data representations - in the context of HCI
and neighbouring fields. I also draw together the key findings
from the experiments presented in earlier chapters and reveal
patterns that appear across these studies.

dissemination of research and list of publications

Much of the content of this thesis has been disseminated in various ways, which has made some of the findings available to a
larger audience than the readers of the thesis. Additionally, almost every part of this thesis has been presented and discussed

1.4 dissemination of research and list of publications

at public talks, seminars and doctorial consortiums. I believe
that my work has benefited from this dissemination through
valuable suggestions and revisions from my supervisor, colleagues, anonymous reviewers, and co-authorship. While every
publication that I list below was co-authored with my supervisor Professor Dr. Eva Hornecker, the work described in Chapter
Seven was also carried out in collaboration with Dr. Uta Hinrichs, who helped me gain an overview of the state-of-the-art in
the field of InfoVis. In the introduction of each chapter in this
thesis I highlight the parts that have already been published, I
also briefly describe the adaptions that appear in this thesis. In

Part I
T H E O RY A N D D E S I G N
In this part of my thesis I discuss the theoretical and
design foundations of my research. I present these
across four chapters. In Chapter 2, I introduce Phenomenology as the basis of the philosophical and
methodological approach of my research. I follow
this in Chapter 3 by discussing two other central aspects of my thesis: data representation and evaluation.
Here I present a historical overview of these aspects
and describe current approaches, techniques, tools,
technologies and methods used in the creation and
evaluation of data representations. In Chapter 4, I
bridge the gap between theory and design by describing a design exercise, which produced two bespoke data driven artefacts that represent scientific
data for casual users. I also present an analysis of
these designs that is framed around the philosophical concepts that I introduce in Chapter 2. In the
final chapter of this part, I present a survey of the
state-of-the-art in data representation over the course
of 150-years. In particular I focus on examples that
require more than one modality to fully interpret
the representation. Using a database of 154 example, which I collected over the course of my PhD,
I define and establish a design space for multisensory data representation, to help system designers
reason about decisions on data representation and
to assist researchers better understand the study of
data representation through and beyond the visual
modality.

THE PHENOMENOLOGICAL LANDSCAPE

With this we meet a science, of whose extraordinary extent our
contemporaries have as yet no concept; a science; is true, of
consciousness that is none the less not psychology, a phenomenology
of consciousness as opposed to a natural science of consciousness.
— (Edmund Husserl, 1965)

2.1

introduction

In this chapter, I present the philosophical and methodological foundation of my research approach. I first provide a brief
overview of the foundations of philosophical phenomenology,
before focusing on the work of four thinkers: Edmund Husserl,
Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde, whose
ideas provide an important theoretical backdrop to the critique
and study of experiencing data representation. I conclude this
chapter by discussing the role phenomenology has played in
the field of HCI.
2.2

husserl and the beginnings of philosophical
phenomenology

The term phenomenology appears in more than one context,
it first entered the lexicon of philosophical writings during the
Age of Enlightenment when Immanuel Kant and G. W. F. Hegel
began using it. However, phenomenology in its modern philosophical sense began with the work of the German philosopher
Edmund Husserl (1859-1938), who established Phenomenology
as an important tradition within 20th century European Philosophy, alongside others such as Structuralism or Existentialism.
Phenomenology can also be seen as a research approach and is
the study of “what comes to light” or the study of phenomenon.
Etymologically, it is a fusion of the Greek phainómenon (that
which appears) and logos (study, words and reasons). Essentially, taking a phenomenology approach involves trying to provide an account of how things appear to our awareness and

15

16

the phenomenological landscape

ultimately how the world appears to us - in terms of our subjective experience. In other words, phenomenology is about reflecting upon our everyday experience to gain some sense of
its underlying order, structure and coherence. It is descriptive
rather that explanatory, it focuses on describing the experience
that we have. So instead of trying to explain “why” we have
a certain experience, we bracket that, and focus purely on describing the experience.
The origin of this philosophical movement rests with Husserl
recognising that science and mathematics were increasingly conducted on an abstract plane and were disconnected from human experience and understanding. He sought to redress this
imbalance by envisioning a science that was firmly grounded
on the phenomena of experience, which in turn meant developing the philosophy of experience as a rigorous science [114].
One of phenomenology’s fundamental building blocks, which
Husserl’s framework is built upon, is a reaction to the idea of
the Natural attitude, where we proceed through our lives with a
common natural belief, we see things around us, such as physical objects, other people, and even ideas, as simply real and
we don’t question their existence: we view them as facts. In
contrast to the natural attitude, Husserl advocated adopting a
phenomenological attitude, wherein, we suspend or bracket our
belief in the natural attitude by recognizing that it is merely a
belief. This act of bracketing, which is also known as the epoché,
allows us to turn our attention to the on-going activity of consciousness to which our experience of reality is ultimately constituted. Husserl termed the overall act of using the epoché as
a phenomenological reduction. By adopting a phenomenological reduction we in turn assume a phenomenological attitude
toward our experience. To explain this, let me use the example
of how we experience time. From the perspective of the natural
attitude, an hour of time is simply an hour no matter where or
how we spend it. Whereas, if we employ a phenomenological attitude, an hour of time depends on how we experience it. For instance an hour may pass slowly if we are bored or very quickly
if we are excited, so the meaning of time can vary significantly
depending upon whether we are viewing it from the perspective of a natural attitude or from that of a phenomenological
attitude. The same is true for other facets of our lives, including how we experience data. From the perspective of the natural attitude, data may be seen as, for instance, simply discrete

2.3 martin heidegger

numerical points, however, if we view data through the lens
of a phenomenological attitude our experience maybe altered
depending on variables such as the representational modality,
past personal experience or even the mood we are in at the time
of experiencing the data.
Another important aspect of phenomenology that Husserl developed is the idea that consciousness or human experience, is,
by its very nature, intentional. Based on earlier work by Franz
Brentano, whom Husserl studied under, the theory of intentionality describes the way experiences are both actional and referential in nature, in that they involve an activity and always refer to something external. For example, the kind of experience
we have when reading a data representation involves the activity of interpretation, this is the action-oriented aspect of data
experience, which in phenomenological parlance is known as
a “Noesis”. At the same time, data experience is referential –
which may be a specific data set and the representational format, which is known as a “Noema”. Husserl suggested phenomenology as a research approach to uncover the relationship
between the objects of experience (Noema) and our mental experiences of those objects (Noesis). The results of adopting such as
approach would provide an account of how Noesis and Noema
cohere and unfold over time. In respect to data experience, a
phenomenology of data experience would aim at exploring how
that specifically happens.
Exploring human experience - in this way - occupied Husserl
for several decades. However, toward the end of his life he recast his vision of phenomenology in terms of exploring what
he called the “lifeworld” (lebenswelt). Basically the lifeworld is
the total assemblage of the entire world, as we know it, including the inter-subjective, social spheres of everyday experiences.
This shift in emphasis heralded the beginning of existential phenomenology, whose notably exponents include Martin Heidegger.
2.3

martin heidegger

While Husserl conceived phenomenology as a purely descriptive process - collecting information about people’s experience
of the world and letting others reflect on its meaning - Martin
Heidegger (1889-1976) viewed phenomenology as a process to

17

18

the phenomenological landscape

understand and interpret what it means to exist in the world.
His view transformed phenomenology, from a tradition that focused on epistemological questions, such as, how can we know
about the world? to ontological ones, such as, how does the
world reveal itself to us through our encounters with it? Central to this shift in perspective is Heidegger’s concept of Dasein,
which is a fundamental aspect of all his work. Translated as
“being-in-the-world”, Dasein emphasizes the way in which ‘being’ or ‘existence’ is inseparable from the world in which it occurs, it is the essence of being human. Although Heidegger was
a prolific writer and his lifework reaches out to many aspects
of human existence, only the aspects that are of direct relevance
to data representation will be treated here. With this in mind,
I first discuss his thoughts on how people’s use of equipment
mediates our understanding of the world, I then follow by presenting his concept of Time.
2.3.1

Equipment

Heidegger recognised that what makes the world meaningful
to us is that we encounter it in a practical way. In his view, human beings engage with the world around us through things
and items that surround us, such things he refers to, in a very
Heideggerian way, as the equipment-of-our-lives [95]. He essentially posits two important ideas that encapsulate the term
equipment. First, equipment in our lives is not simply a tool,
but is a tool for some task or as Heidegger phrases it: “equipment is essentially something in-order-to” [95, p.99]. To explain
this concept Heidegger poses a paradox - the more useful equipment is the less apparent is its’ presence, it recedes before the
work toward which the equipment is oriented. For example,
when we write on a page with a pencil, our attention is not
focused on the pencil, instead it is on the words that are appearing on the page as we write. Only when the equipment
(pencil) no longer functions smoothly does it draw attention to
itself. Second is that equipment does not stand-alone, there is
no such a thing as ’an equipment’. Equipment is always linked
to other equipment in the way that it relies upon, works with,
suggests, is similar or dissimilar to, or is otherwise related to
other equipment. For example, a pencil cannot function (or exist) without something to write on, so the pencil relies upon
other equipment to act as a surface to display what has been

2.3 martin heidegger

written or drawn.
Heidegger also thinks beyond the existential being of equipment, toward ways that Dasein is in relation to equipment. Heidegger essentially says that we encounter equipment in two
forms, he calls the first form ready-to-hand (zuhanden), which
he describes as what happens when we use equipment. The
second form he refers to as present-at-hand (vorhanden) to indicate what happens when we stare at, but do not use it - such
an object is encounter through pure theoretical contemplation.
Based on this idea we can categorise certain equipment as being
either ready-to-hand or present-at-hand. However, we may also encounter certain equipment as being both forms, depending on
the context. For example, if we return again to the pencil, when
in normal use a pencil may be considered as ready-to-hand, however if we encounter a pencil in a museum, which was, for instance, once used by a famous writer, this would be considered
to be present-at-hand, as we can not pick it up and start using
it, instead we merely contemplate on its past use by its original
owner.
We should, however, not consider these forms of encountering equipment as being mutually exclusive. We often shift from
one to the other when using equipment. Heidegger considers
this skilful coping, to be when we shift quickly from one mode
to the other in a very inexpert unready-to-hand way [311] [51]. To
exemplify this, when a pencil is encountered as ready-to-hand, it
is being used to write on a page, however, if our skilful coping
is temporarily disturbed (if the lead tip breaks), we may shift
to present-at-hand, where we contemplate on how to repair the
pencil, or even unready-to-hand, which Blattner [16] considers
as a deficient mode of ready-to-hand, by continuing to use the
damaged pencil so we do not see through the pencil any more,
as our attention is divided between the words on the page and
maintaining the functionality of the pencil.
2.3.2

Temporality

Another one of Heidegger’s ideas that is important for our understanding of how people interpret data representations, is
how he conceives temporality. Heidegger makes a distinction
between temporality and time, he postulates that time is what
temporality becomes when it is reduced to clock time, or as Hei-

Table 1: Heidegger’s conception of the three phases of temporality.

degger puts it public-time. Time, as he sees it, is orderly and
chronometric, whereas temporality is diverse, a kind of primordial time [95, p.79]. The diversity of temporality also mirrors
the fact that time always arrives in three phases: past, present,
and future.
He reinterprets these phases, asserting that there is an authentic and an inauthentic mode for each (see Table 1). If we
consider the phase of temporality know as the future, Heidegger thinks of this as being the world ahead of itself, where we
project the possibilities of what is to come. He considers the authentic projection of the future to be anticipation, where we actively seek the possibilities of our future. While its inauthentic
counterpart is expectation, where we passively await whatever
the future brings. Heidegger characterized the past, as havingbeen, however, if we conceive of the past as being elapsed entirely, this, he believes, is an inauthentic mode of connecting
with the past. When we authentically relate to the past we
bring ourselves face-to-face with what Heidegger would call
our throwness, or situatedness in the world. He considers repeatability to be the authentic motive for considering the past.
When experiencing the present, Heidegger notes that we connect with it in an authentic mode through a moment-of-vision,
where we rise toward the opportunities as the become available, he terms this reaction as making-present, whereas as an
inauthentic mode will result in us by turning away from what
is before us.
In relation to the perception and interpretation of data, Heidegger’s ideas on temporality are of particular interest. If we
consider, for instance, the way we experience representations
of live data; one may experience the data as it is represented
(in the present) in an authentic way through as a moment of
vision (the generation of data insight) or one could act in an

unauthentic way by turning away and shielding oneself from the
representation. Live data representation also have future possibilities (data yet to be represented), which one may wait for in
expectation (inauthentic) or in a mode of anticipation (authentic).
Once we have perceived the data, this perception immediately
becomes part of our past, we could treat this past memory as
having lapsed entirely (inauthentic) or we could make better use
of it (authentic) by recognizing the situatedness of the data, basically, that is was there for a reason and we can learn from
it.
2.4

maurice merleau-ponty

Another thinker whose work strongly influenced my understanding of how we perceive and experience data is Maurice
Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961). His approach to philosophy, and
the ideas he developed can be traced back to the two thinkers I
discussed already. In particular he inherited a concern for questions of perception from Husserl, and from Heidegger, he inherited an orientation toward being situated in the world. MerleauPonty reconciled these two perspectives by focusing on the role
of the human body in perception. This is best seen in his magnum opus: The Phenomenology of Perception, which was first published in 1945 (with an English translation appearing in 1962),
where he deals directly with the nature of the human body and
of perception. The concepts that are of special interest to the
study of how people experience and perceive data include his
idea of the Body Schema and Maximal Grip.
2.4.1

The Body Schema

It may seem obvious now, but Merleau-Ponty was one of the
first thinkers to recognise the important role our body plays
in perceiving the world around us. He claimed that the body
gives us a prior understanding of the world, through our direct perception of it, stating, “the body is our general medium
for having a world” [189, p.146]. It is this aspect of his work
that differentiates his ideas from other phenomenologists that
came before him. Although Heidegger acknowledged that we
make sense of the world around us in a practical may, he never
specifically attributed the formation of meaning to the body
and Husserl did not address the role of the body in any of his

21

22

the phenomenological landscape

major writings.
Central to Merleau-Ponty’s exploration of the role the body
plays in perception is his idea of the body schema. Essentially,
body schema is a form of bodily awareness referring to how we
understand our body in space. It is a dynamic structure that reveals the body’s orientation, not just towards existing, but also
towards possible tasks. There are three essential features that
constitute Merleau-Ponty’s body schema: (1) although our body
is comprised of different parts, we perceive it as a unified entity,
(2) while he implies there is an inside and outside of the body
schema, all these parts are within, and (3) humans have an innate ability to know where the body parts are positioned in relation to each other, without having to consciously think about
it. He summarises these features as: “The outline of my body
is a frontier which ordinary spatial relations do not cross. This
is because its parts are inter-related in a peculiar way: they are
not spread out side by side, but enveloped in each other.” [189,
p.112].
Another important aspect of body schema relates to how we
normally experience our body. While we typically experience
the external world as a spatial structure relative to us, this is
not the case for our own body. To explain this, think, for a moment, about viewing the world around us while wearing dark
sunglasses. One can easily imagine that we are experiencing
the glasses, as the world will appear darker to us, however, we
do not experience the glasses as being located somewhere in
the world, they have been enveloped into our body schema. The
same is true for our body, just like sunglasses, our body is a
medium through which we experience the world. This analogy
also illustrates how the body schemais flexible and can be extended, either temporarily or near-permanently, through the
use of tools. According to Merleau-Ponty, when we become
adept at using tools they become incorporated into the body
schema, as an extension of our body parts. Thus, these tools
are experienced and used as part of the process by which we
engage with the external world, and not an object in-the-world
that we engage with, an idea that is very similar to Heidegger’s
concept of ready-to-hand. For example, if we consider a child
starting to learn how to draw with a pencil, this process involves first learning to grip the pencil correctly, which requires
them to be constantly attentive to the position and angle of the

2.4 maurice merleau-ponty

pencil between their fingers and thumb. Now think about how
a pencil is used by a skilled draftsman, years of practise has
enabled him to use the pencil with little or no awareness of its
position in relation to the body parts that are holding it. The
pencil (when in use) has ceased to exist as object in the external
world and has become part of the draftsman’s body schema.
2.4.2

Maximum Grip

A central theme in The Phenomenology of Perception is the idea of
the tight coupling between the body and the world. MerleauPonty refers to this as the intentional arc. Accordingly, the intentional arc is an often pre-reflective or precognitive process
that brings about a unity of our senses and intelligence in a tendency to achieve a maximum grip [189, p.157]. This tendency is
our body responding to a given situation to achieve the optimal
visibility. However, we do not necessarily need to know what
that optimum is, our body is simply solicited by the situation to
get into equilibrium with it, or as Merleau-Ponty puts it: “Our
body is not an object for an ‘I think’, it is a grouping of livedthrough meanings which moves towards its equilibrium.” [189,
p.153]. Essentially, this means, when we look at an image, such
as a painting, we tend to, without having to think about it, position ourselves at an optimal distance and angle to capture the
entire picture in full clarity. The same idea can also be applied
to other modalities, for instance, when we grasp a physical object, without thinking, we position and rotate it in our hands is
a response to the form or functionality of the object. Also, when
we perceive sounds our body innately responds to the stimulation to achieve the optimal conditions for listing, for instance,
we may bend down and direct our ear towards a sound that is
difficult to hear. In essence, getting the maximum grip involves
our human body responding to stimuli to get into equilibrium
with it, or as Merleau-Ponty puts it: “to get the detail and the
maximum clarity of the form.” [189, p.371].
There are however certain situations where achieving a maximum grip requires a cognitive response instead of a physical
one. In relation to this, Merleau-Ponty questioned: what happens to our perception of an object if you are unable to see
it whole? For instance, when we look at mountains from a
distance—although we are unable to, we are motivated to see
them from behind, but if this is not feasible, we project our own

23

24

the phenomenological landscape

reality on to the mountains backside. According to MerleauPonty our perception of these hidden parts is grounded in reality and we stimuli meaningful structures, so we would perceive
the other side of the mountains as normal [189, p.302]. This concept has direct implications for data representation, especially
those that represent time series data. For example, when we
perceive a data representation, does our perception cease at the
final data point or, as Merleau-Ponty suggests, do we project/perceive into the future based on what has came before it?

don ihde

Phenomenology has a rich and complex background that continues to evolve today. Since the inception of modern phenomenology by Husserl at the turn of the 20th Century, a number of
schools and movements have developed, each of which embrace different values and characteristics, but all adhere to the
fundamental principle of phenomenology: the philosophical study
of the structures of experience and consciousness. Often these
phenomenological movements are identified with the thoughts
and approaches of key scholars. For instance, Husserl’s approach
became known as Transcendental or Pure phenomenology, which
is described as the study of how objects are constituted in pure
or transcendental consciousness [199]. Following this, Heidegger’s take on the tradition became known as Existential phenomenology; the study of concrete human existence, including our experience of free choice or action in concrete situations [322]. Whereas Merleau Ponty was known to practice
Hermeneutical phenomenology, which can be described as the
study of interpretive structures of experience, to comprehend
how we understand and engage things in our world [155]. The
final set of ideas that I present in this chapter were developed
by the phenomenological philosopher of technology: Don Ihde,
who initiated a school of thought known as Post-phenomenology.
2.5.1

Post-phenomenology

When encountering post-phenomenology for the first time, we
should not confuse the use of the prefix ‘Post’ with a shift in
subject matter or the separation of Ihde’s movement from the
traditions of phenomenology that came before it. It is more
like a transition or evolution in thinking much in the same
way post-modernism is still part of the larger project of moder-

2.5 don ihde

nity. Post-phenomenology still retains some of the important
themes of phenomenological philosophy (intentionality, embodiment, and the lifeworld), but changes the philosophical boundaries. Ihde dismisses transcendental truths and restrictions to
consciousness; instead he develops a pragmatic style (adapted
from Deweyan pragmatism) that is experimental and contingent [234].
2.5.2

Human-technology relations

One of Ihde’s most well known ideas, which transcend a lot
of his major literary works, is his theory of Human-Technology
Relations. This theory accounts for the various ways technology
mediates people’s experience of the world, or as Ihde’s explains,
the goal of this theory is to “show what is invariable in the way
humans experience their technologies” [116, p.111]. Principally,
it provides a meaningful taxonomy or framework to give an account of everyday interaction or engagement with technology.
According to Ihde, the relations we have with technology can
be described as: Background, Embodiment, Hermeneutic, or Alterity. While these relations can be viewed as discrete modes of experiencing the world through technology, they can also be seen
together as a dimension that represents our technological mediated experience of the world, from complete emersion with
technology (embodiment) to complete withdrawal (background).
In the following I present a brief description of each relation, as
well as presenting how this theory can be applied to the study
of data representation.
embodiment relations According to Ihde, an embodiment relation is characterized by technology becoming transparent or withdrawing from our perceptual awareness. The focus of the human is not on the technology but on the content
that it is referring to. Ihde presents it as being a partial symbiosis of a human and technology, where the technology is embodied and becomes “perceptually transparent” [116, p.99]. In the
context of data representation an example of technology that affords this type of relationship is a digital microscope. Unlike a
traditional optical microscope, which simply magnifies an image through a series of lens, a digital microscope uses optics
and a digital camera to output an image to a digital display,
sometimes by means of software running on a computer. Thus,
the image that appears on the digital display is a representation

25

26

the phenomenological landscape

of the data that is captured by the camera and computed by the
software. When we use a digital microscope we see through
the display to what is being represented. It is important to note,
however, that the degree of perceptual transparency one experiences is dependent on a number of factors, including, for instance the familiarity -and experience with the technology and
domain. For expert users of digital microscopes this technology offers direct experience of the phenomena, whereas novice
users may view the output as static or animated visuals on a
display, and not as a collection of pixels that embody the phenomenon under investigation.
hermeneutical relations The second category of Ihde’s
Human technology relations is what he calls Hermeneutical, which
involves reading and interpretation of the technology. This is
categorised as when we are focused on the technology, however,
what one actually sees—immediately and simultaneously—is
not the technology itself but rather the world it refers to. Ihde’s
analysis emphasizes the materiality of the technology being
“read” while the world is being referenced. While an embodiment relationinvolves the technology being transparent, hermeneutical relations has a “semi-opaque” connection between the technology and the world [116, p.86]. Arguably, the predominant
relationship that humans have with data representations is a
hermeneutical one. If we broadly define data representations as
artefacts that represents data in a certain modality, and which
requires interpretation in order to form some insight about the
underlying data, then perhaps we maintain a hermeneutical relationship with all data representations. An example that facilitates a hermeneutical relationship is a thermometer. When we
read the output on a thermometer, instead of contemplating on
the height of the mercury or the numerical display, one could
argue we immediately see or envisage the world it represents.
alterity relations According to Ihde, Alterity relations
happens when the objectiveness of technology comes fully into
presence, and is characterized by a relation to a “technological other”, something “stronger than mere objectiveness but
weaker than the otherness found within the animal kingdom
or the human one” [116, p.100]. The term ‘alterity’ is borrowed
from the philosophy of Emmanuel Levinas [159], and refers to
the special experience of the presence of another person. Thus
some of our relations to technology partially resemble the ex-

2.6 phenomenology in hci

perience of interacting with a person or a “quasi-other” [116,
p.97]. Ihde argues that alterity relations emerge in a wide range
of computer technologies that display a quasi-otherness within
the limits of linguistics and, more particularly, of logical behaviours. Arguably, no other technology exemplifies these characteristics more clearly than in-car satellite navigation systems
(SatNav). Once a SatNav has been programmed, it occupies our
attention as a quasi-other, to which we relate to by obeying intelligent directions verbalised by the device. When describing alterity relations, Ihde also discusses the fascination humans have
always had with the quasi-autonomy of technology. This fascination is very evident with a SatNav, however, with this also
comes a degree of trust involved in this relationship. When this
breaks down (we reach a dead-end) this fascination and trust
may turn into frustration and even rage, not with oneself but
with the quasi-other.
background relations The final relation in Ihde’s theory of human-technology relations is Background. This is understood as something that is “presence absence”, something
that we do not experience directly yet it gives structure to our
experience. He states, “background technologies, no less than
other focal ones, transform the gestalts of human experience
and, precisely because they are absence presences, may exert
more subtle indirect effects upon the way the world is experienced” [116, p.109]. Many automated, electronic and digital systems, such as, for instance, an air conditioning system, are experienced as a background relation, we do not directly experience
the air conditioning system directly, however, our experience of
the world is directly affected by it. The account given by Ihde
to describe this relation may also be used to describe the concept of ambient visualizations or displays. These technologies
are generally defined as a category of data visualizations that
convey time-varying data in the periphery of human awareness.
So, unlike most visualizations, which are experienced directly,
ambient visualizations reside on the periphery or background
of our consciousness.
2.6

phenomenology in hci

Originally conceived in the early nineteen eighties as a blend
of psychology and computer science, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is concerned with the design, development and

27

28

the phenomenological landscape

evaluation of interaction computer-based systems. While it has
long since emerged as a research domain in its own right, HCI
is still often regarded as the intersection of computer science,
psychology, design and several other fields of study. The history
of HCI research can be considered as having three consecutive
phases or waves. While the first wave is categorised by its focus on large-scale, rule-based scenarios, the second focused on
single individuals, who stand alone with different conditions,
and the third, which encompasses contemporary HCI research,
is typically considered as being focused on different individuals in a state of multi-user communication [94] [18]. Concurrent
with these evolutionary phases, have been many theoretical and
paradigm shifts in HCI. Recently Harrison and colledgues [91]
argued that there are now three competing paradigms. The
first two have their roots in human factors and classical cognitivist science, respectively, while the third has its base in Phenomenology. While the human factors paradigm tends to focus
on optimizing man-machine fit, the paradigm that draws inspiration from classical cognitivism focuses on the relationship between the computer and the mind. The third paradigm discards
the emphasis on the information processing model, instead it
embraces topics such as the experiential quality of interaction,
meaning making and the central metaphor is interaction as phenomenologically situated [91].
Winograd and Flores are considered to be the first to introduce the relevance of Phenomenology to the HCI research community through their influential book Understanding Computers and Cognition [317]. In this book they critique the use of
theories from the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and suggest a phenomenological based approach for HCI. In particular
they state that the theories of Heidegger are better suited to
the study and design of technology. The findings of Winograd
and Flores draw heavily from the work of Hubert Dreyfus, especially his book What Computers Can’t Do [54], which was itself
influenced by theories from Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty. The
contribution Winograd and Flores offered to the HCI community can be summed up in four ideas they developed from Heidegger’s thoughts, these are: (1) we should assume an interpretive or hermeneutic view of the world, (2) our ability to interpret
and understand the world around us is based on our ability to
be in it, (3) the rejection of the idea that we relate to things, primarily, through having representations of them in our minds,

2.6 phenomenology in hci

and (4) social activity is the foundation of meaning [317] [208].
Although it would be a number years before these ideas were
fully embraced by the HCI community, their work marks a turn
towards phenomenological thinking, which was developed further by Dag Svanœs, Paul Dourish, Toni Robertson and others
at the beginning of the 21st Century.
2.6.1

The Phenomenological Turn

The turn of the 21st century also marked, what some consider
an “embodied turn” for HCI research [208] [251]. It reflects a
shift in emphasis away from modelling complex cognitive processes - as the basis of understanding interaction - and moves
towards reinstating the body as central to where interaction
takes place[208]. The genesis of this turn is usually attributed
to the work of Paul Dourish and his book Where the Action is
[52] but other notably researchers, including Dag Svanœs and
Toni Robertson, also made valuable contributions.
“Where the Action is” takes a phenomenologically informed
perspective on HCI by drawing on the writings of Heidegger,
Merleau-Ponty, Schutz and Wittgenstein. One of the key contributions of this work is the discussion and definition of the
term embodied interaction. Using Merleau-Ponty’s Phenomenology of Perception [189] as a theoretical basis, he defines this
new paradigm in interaction design as “the creation, manipulation, and sharing of meaning through engaged interaction with
art[i]facts.” [52, p.126]. Essentially, this means that it is the user
(not the designer) who creates meaning, and consequently their
own experience, through engagement and interaction with digital artefacts. In emphasising the role of embodiment in interaction design, Dourish proposes this as the basis for how we
should approach social and tangible computing as social practise.
Another notion introduced by Dourish is that of coupling.
By drawing together three aspects of meaning: ontology, intersubjectivity, and intentionality, he describes coupling as the
means by which we build relationships between entities. It is
concerned with making the relationship between action and
meaning more effective, or as Dourish puts it: “Intentional connection that arises in the course of interaction. Designers can
only suggest coupling, yet intentionally make it.” [52, p.172].

29

30

the phenomenological landscape

Essentially, Dourish conceives intentionality as the relationship
between actions and meaning, and coupling relates to how we
manage this relationship [208]. For instance, if we take sawing a piece of wood as an example, coupling relates to how we
mange the relationship between: the intention to saw (to make
a table), the props that we need to execute the action (the saw
and wood), the knowledge we possess to complete the action
(woodworking skills), and the cultural significance of making a
table for others to use.
Dag Svanæs also promoted the application of phenomenology to the study and design of technology. In particular, Svanæs
advocated the use of Merleau-Ponty’s work to explore the concept of interactivity, kinaesthetic aspects of interactions, and the
importance of rediscovering the ‘feel dimension’ and the design of context-aware technology [276] [277]. By embracing phenomenology’s focus on the first person and the body, Svanæs
suggests this enables researchers to develop a deeper understanding of such systems from the perspective of the user, or
as he puts it “an application of his embodied perspective on
cognition and interaction enabled an analysis of the elements
of interaction for context-aware systems.” [277, p.397]. As part
of an exploration into the role phenomenology can play in interactivity, Svanæs carried out a series of psychological experiments exploring how we make sense of and structure an interactive experience. These empirical studies were analysed from
the phenomenological perspective of Heidegger and MerleauPonty [276]. More recently, Svanæs reiterated his view on phenomenology in HCI [278], by arguing that technological developments and the increased availability of digital technology,
which is intrinsically tangible, mobile, social, and ubiquitous,
have made phenomenology even more relevant than at the turn
of the century.
Another researcher who was at the forefront of drawing attention to the relevance of phenomenology in the field of HCI
and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) is Toni
Robertson. In particular she used the phenomenology ideas of
Merleau-Ponty to develop a taxonomy of embodied actions that
serve communicative functions in CSCW [246] [248]. This taxonomy is intended to assist researchers and designers structure
the results of field studies, to bridge the gap between work practices and the design of technology for distributed teams. This

2.6 phenomenology in hci

was also envisaged to help designers recognise the actions that
current systems do not, or could never support [248]. Shifting
the emphasis slightly, while still leveraging the concepts basic
to a phenomenological understanding of perception, Robertson
also showed how a phenomenological perspective, grounded
in the public availability of actions and artefacts, could provide a common theoretical foundation for designers to maintain awareness of distributed activities [245] [249].
The work of Dourish, Svanæs and Robertson stimulated new
discussions in HCI about the use of phenomenology as a theoretical basis for research. Since then, phenomenological notions of, in particular Merleau Ponty, has received a lot of attention. Hornecker and Buur[111] reference Merleau-Ponty when
presenting their theoretical framework for tangible interaction,
Fallman referred in depth to Merleau Ponty’s emphasis on the
role of the body when presenting a phenomenology of mobile
interaction [60], Antle and colleagues use Merleau Ponty to support their inquiry on the role embodied metaphors play in physical interaction in augmented spaces [7]. Moen [195] also uses
Merleau-Ponty’s concern for the body when studying human
movement and designing for a kinaesthetic interaction experience, and Veerapen [293] draws on Merleau Ponty’s theories to
examine how a new kind of being is formed subsequent to the
user’s interaction with the computer.
The work of Merleau-Ponty still remains highly relevant in
HCI research, especially in special interest communities such
as Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI). As the role of the
body is of prime importance to many researchers in this community, the concepts of Merleau-Ponty continue to influence
and inspire work. For example, the notion of embodied sensemaking, which was first introduced at TEI 2015[112], and can
be traced directly back to Merleau-Ponty’s concept of embodiment and skilful coping. A selection of other work recently
published at the annual TEI conference, which have been either directly or indirectly influenced by the work of MerleauPonty include: [273] [147] [49] [166] [267] [241]. Outside of the
TEI community, the impact of Merleau-Ponty has also been
felt by: [160] [152] [211] [50] [46] [137] [110]. For a comprehensive overview of Merleau-Ponty’s influence on the field of HCI
see: [278].

31

32

the phenomenological landscape

The work of Don Ihde has also received some attention within
HCI literature. Rosenberger uses his theories to describe the experience of slowly-loading webpages [254]. While Rosenberger
also draws on the concepts of Heidegger, and in particular
his philosophy of technology to describe the way people experience interacting with computers, he postulates that this relationship (between human and computer) is best described
using Ihde’s concept of embodiment relations (as described
above). He argues, when using a keyboard people are more
aware of the words appearing on-screen than we are of our finger tips making contact with the keys (the technology becomes
transparent). However, this, he argues, breaks down when confronted with slow-loading webpages: “the transparency of our
embodiment relation that significantly changes when we experience the jarring sensation of suddenly encountering a slowlyloading webpage” [254, p.1]. He refers to this sudden shift
of awareness as a transparency break, a sudden loss of transparency while experiencing the world through technology. Pierce
and Paulos [226] also explored how people experience electrical
energy through the lens of Ihde’s human-technology relations.
However, unlike Rosenberger, who used just one of Ihde’s technology relations to describe a phenomenon, Pierce and Paulos sought to explore people’s experience of electrical energy
through all four relations (background, embodiment, hermeneutic
and alterity).
While the work of Merleau-Ponty and Ihde has had an impact on theoretical developments in HCI and neighbouring fields,
there is other work that relies on phenomenology in a more
general sense. McCarthy and Wright take a phenomenological
perspective to develop a discourse surrounding felt life within
HCI [180] and Vaughan [292] uses this view when claiming
the lived relationship between user and object is an evolving
participatory act. In regards to design, Frauenberger and colleagues [72] argued that phenomenology plays a critical role
in participatory design and Stienstra suggests that designers
should adopt the core values of phenomenology, such as embracing direct experiences and emphasizing that life and the
world are deeply intertwined [272].

2.7 chapter summary

2.7

chapter summary

In this chapter, I presented the philosophical and methodological foundation of my research. Starting first with the historical
background to phenomenology, I moved through the centuries,
stopping briefly to describe some important ideas that help to
understand how people experience data representations. From
Husserl’s use of intentionally, over Heidegger’s concept of temporality and equipment, to Merleau-Ponty’s discourse on the body
schema and maximum grip, finishing with Idhe’s novel concept
of human-technology relations. The importance of these ideas may
not seem relevant as yet, but as the following chapters unfold
their significance will become apparent as I tease out and describe how people experience data. In the second part of this
chapter I presented the role phenomenology has played in the
field of HCI and showed how it has received increased attention in later years. Phenomenology in HCI is not considered
to be a novel departure anymore; it is now commonly used as
the basis for developing new theoretical frameworks (cf. [111]
as well as the foundation of research approaches (cf. [254]. In
this thesis I exploit both aspects of phenomenology. First, by
using ideas developed within the tradition to help describe the
way people experience data, and second, as the foundation of
the methodological approach I use for the study of how people
experience data.

introduction

Following on from phenomenology, I now discuss the two other
central parts of my thesis: data representation and evaluation. This
chapter is dedicated to presenting a brief historical overview
of data representation and describing current approaches, techniques, tools, technologies and methods used in the practice
and study of data representation. In doing so, I also address
issues related to representational modality and highlight the
different research domains that are actively engaged in topics
related to data representation. Following this, I move on to evaluation and discuss current research that relates to the type of
questions I seek to answer in this thesis. I conclude by presenting commonly used approaches and methodologies that allow
for the capture of people’s experience of data representation1
3.2

data representation

Making sense of and communicating information through data
representations has been engrained in human behaviour for
millennia, from prehistoric cave paintings, over developments
in cartography, onto more recent developments in scientific and
information visualizations. Today the scientific study of data
representation is typically associated with the field of study
known as Information Visualization (InfoVis) [34]. While InfoVis is a relatively new field of research, which only emerged

1 Large parts of the literature review on evaluation methods in InfoViz are
owed to Dr. Uta Hinrichs, co-author on [102], who helped us gain an
overview of the state-of-the-arts in this field. In this chapter I extend the
discussion to include other researcher fields such as HCI.

in the 1990’s, its lineage can be traced back to specific milestones dating from the middle of the last millennium. To fully
appreciate and critique contemporary data representation, it is
important to, at the very least, acknowledge the evolution of
this discipline. Although a full historical appraisal of data representation is beyond the scope of this thesis, in the following
I outline some of the key technical and intellectual milestones
that enabled the practise and study of data representation to be
fully embraced by the scientific and academic community, for
a more thorough discussion of these developments see [74].
Amongst the earliest evidence of data being represented in
pursuit of scientific goals is a 10th Century graph that depicts
the movement of celestial bodies over time [287, p.28]. This
graph (see Figure 1) was far ahead of its time, as the graphical nuances, such as the use of sinusoidal variation and grids,
would not be fully developed until the 17th-18th Century. Somewhat later, in the 14th Century, the idea of plotting a theoretical
function and the logical relationship of tablature values first appeared.
The 16th Century heralded intellectual and technical developments, including, (1) advancements in triangulation to determine mapping locations more precisely, (2) the initial idea
of image capturing and the invention of the camera obscura,
and (3) the publication of the first modern cartographic atlas

3.2 data representation

Figure 2: Chart by William Playfair (1821) depicting wages (line plot),
prices of wheat (bar graph), and historical context (timelines).

(Teatrum Orbis Terrarum by Abraham Ortelius, 1570). These
developments, along with others, signify for many the beginnings of modern data visualization [74]. The use of data representation increased in the 17th Century, especially for those
who were concerned with physical measurement, such as astronomers, surveyors, mapmakers and navigators. Developments
in the 17th Century paved the way for what was to come later.
By the turn of the 18th Century the fundamental elements of
modern data representation were in place, these were: (1) relatively easy access to data, (2) theories to make sense of them,
and (3) ideas for their visual representation [74]. The most notable developments in the 18th Century can be attributed to
William Playfair (1759–1823). Known widely as the father of
modern data visualization, he invented a number of data visualization techniques used widely today, including the line graph,
bar chart [229], pie chart and circle graph [230].
The graphs and charts invented by Playfair and others, such
as Florence Nightingale, were the first to be used to stimulate
political and social debate. For example, Playfair depicted the
price of wheat, weekly wages, and reigning monarch over a
250—year span from 1565 to 1820 (see Figure 2), and used
this graph to argue that workers had become better off in the
most recent years. Nightingale also created many novel representation techniques, including the Coxcomb or as it’s known
today—the polar area diagram. She used this to persuade Queen

Figure 3: Florence Nightingale’s Coxcomb graph depicting the mortality in the army in the Crimean War.

Victoria of the need to improve sanitary conditions in military
hospitals during and after the Crimean War (see Figure 3). This
new widespread use of data representation, as well as innovations in design and technology seeded an explosive growth in
statistical graphics in the first half of the 19th Century, at a rate
that would not be equalled until the turn of the 21st Century.
As well as the array of techniques invented by Playfair and
Nightingale, other representation formats invented in the 19th
Century include Histograms, Time-series plots, Contour plots,
Scatterplots, and so forth. Because of these, the 19th Century is
now widely considered to be the golden age of graphic representation.
However, the rate of development was short lived as the first
half of the 20th Century saw a shift in emphasis away from the
use of visual representation towards more statistical models. It
was no until the mid 1960’s before enthusiasm was renewed in
the visual representation of data, this was prompted by three
key developments: (1) the publication of John W. Tukey’s widely
acclaimed work, The Future of Data Analysis [288], which called
for the recognition of data analysis as a legitimate branch of
statistics, (2) the publication of Jacques Bertin’s landmark book,
Semiologie Graphique (Semiology of Graphics) [13], which was
intended to provide a theoretical foundation for data visual-

3.2 data representation

ization, and finally (3) the creation of FORTRAN (1957), the
first high-level language for computing, which enabled computers to process statistical data. It may be argued that the
later, alongside other developments in computer technology,
were central to data visualization flourishing in the final quarter of the 20th Century and evolving into a mature, vibrant
and multi-disciplinary research area, known today as Information Visualization (InfoVis). Although there are various definitions of information visualization in the literature the one that
is most commonly cited is: “the use of computer-supported, interactive, visual representations of abstract data to amplify cognition.” [34]. However, the term InfoVis not only refers to the
community of researchers and practitioners who are contributing or have contributed to the field of study, but also encompasses the set of tools, technologies and techniques used in the
visual representation of abstract data. This aspect of InfoVis is
addressed by Stuart Card, when elaborating on the definition
of InfoVis: “information visualization is a set of technologies
that use visual computing to amplify human cognition with
abstract information” [34, p.542].
3.2.1

Beyond the Visual Modality

While the core value of InfoVis and its preceding fields has
been focused on the visual representation of data, recent developments offer us opportunities to represent data through
different modalities. As the medium used to encode data has
moved from the printed page, over digital pixel, towards tangible objects, sonifications and other modalities, we have seen an
increased attention around the field of HCI (cf. [205]) as well
as more artistic endeavours (cf. [250]). Today, the practise and
study of data representation does not exclusively reside within
InfoVis, we now see related work in neighbouring fields such
as Tangible Computing (cf. [213]) and Interaction Design (cf.
[104].
Research on representing data beyond the visual modality
can be traced back to the late 1990’s with developments in Calm
Technology [309], Ambient Displays [318] and Ambient Information Visualization [265]. One of earliest examples ambient or
calm technology is Natalie Jeremijenko’s Dangling String [126].
Produced while Jeremijenko was participating on an artist in
residence programme at Xerox PARC in Palo Alto, California,

39

40

data representation and evaluation

this installation comprises of an 8 foot plastic string suspended
from the celling of at Xerox PARC. The string is connected to
a small electric motor, which is activated each time a bit of information is processed on the companies network. A very busy
network causes the string to whirl fast and is accompanied by
a characteristic noise, while a quiet network causes only small
twitches every few seconds.
The challenge for ambient displays such as Dangling String,
is to place data representations in the environment of the user
or audience instead of a screen on the desktop computer, without being overly obtrusive. Although this focus still remains
today (cf. [123]), developments, such as, easily accessible microcontrollers and rapid prototyping technology have expanded
the field and offered new opportunities for researchers to explore ways of representing data beyond the visual modality.
This approach has been further developed through novel InfoVis subfields, including Information Aesthetics [154], Artistic
Visualization [300] and Data Art [171].
Some attempts have already been made to address and define data representations, which fall outside the typical classification of Information Visualization. In Pousman’s [233] classification of Casual Information Visualization, he delineates this
type of visualization into three categories: ambient, social and
artistic. This definition also addresses the widening of the typical task driven user to that of a lay audience whose motivation
for engaging with visualizations is more personally meaningful
rather than for pure analytical discovery. In acknowledging this
shift, Jansen and Dragicevic proposed a more people-centred
approach by addressing issues related to interaction [123]. This
work establishes an interaction model that can be used to help
describe, compare and critique non-screen based data representations.
Beyond work that attempts to categorise different types of
data representation, in the literature there are numerous theoretical and empirical studies that address issues related to the
representation and perception of data beyond the visual modality. This research is spread over a broad range of research disciplines including: Psychology (cf. [96] [83] [73] [310] [194]), Scientific Visualization (cf. [210]), Information Visualization (cf. [243] [281]),
Human-Computer Interaction (cf. [238] [259]), Geovisualization

3.2 data representation

(cf. [90] [59]), Ergonomics (cf. [257]), Design (cf. [202]), Virtual
Reality (cf. [10]), and Engineering (cf. [89]). In this literature, I
identified four prominent themes: Human perception, Call for
action, Surveys, and Arts based research.

3.2.1.1

Human perception

A number of studies investigated how using more than just
the visual modality affects the capability of human perception.
Warren and Rossano [83] found that tactile perception of transformation properties, such as tilt, size and length, in most cases,
is as accurate as visual perception. Heller [96] illustrated how
the combination of modalities (i.e. touch and visual) can enhance people’s ability to process information, especially for perceiving texture. However, evidence also suggests a limit to the
amount of information people can process (receive, process, remember), which differs depending on the modality or combination of modalities used, Miller refers to this as “the span of
absolute judgement” [194, p.351].
3.2.1.2

Call for action

Throughout the years a number of researchers have called for
more research to be conducted on non-visual representational
modalities. For example, Roberts and Walker [244] encourage
future studies to validate whether combining representational
modalities will reinforce or contradict data insight revealed through
different modalities. They also call for a more unified approach
to the theory of visualization, to encompass the perceptual variables of all representational modalities. Tak and Toet [281] argued for further systematic empirical research to develop design guidelines for multisensory data representations or as they
call them, Sensifications [281, p.558]. They claim that representing complex data through more than the visual modality facilitates a more intuitive and transparent process for the viewer/user. In particular, they suggest that these help the user to (1)
acquire a wider range of detail (bandwidth expansion), (2) fill
in missing information (data completion), and (3) gain a more
holistic data experience (Gestalt forming) [281, p.559]. These aspects were also highlighted by Search [259], who suggests that
utilizing more modalities expands the number of data variables
that can be represented simultaneously. The proposed benefits
of multisensory data representation are similar to those high-

lighted for multimodal displays, including aspects such as: synergy (i.e., merging different modalities in one event or process),
redundancy (i.e., communicating the same information via several modalities), and increased bandwidth of information transfer [256] [212].
3.2.1.3

Surveys

Exploring the state-of-the-art in data representation that utilize
modalities beyond the visual modality has been attempted before. In particular, Card and colleagues [34] explored this space
and defined the term Perceptualization as “a multisensory display of abstract information”. Nesbitt [202] categorized data
representation that utilise more than one modality by using
a multisensory taxonomy based on high-level metaphors including spatial, direct and temporal. In Chapter Five, I present
my own exploration of the design space for multisensory data
representations. This is different from those cited here, in regards to: approach, scope, and contribution. Unlike previous
attempts, I establish a design space through a systematic survey
of existing examples, collected from a wide range of disciplines,
and the dimensions of our design space are closely linked to the
properties and qualities of representations, instead of high-level
taxonomies.

3.2 data representation

3.2.1.4

Arts Based Research and Practise

Apart from theoretical and empirical studies, other research has
taken a more artistic and cultural view of data representations.
Alongside the numerous articles in which new media theorist
Lev Manovich (cf. [171]) highlights the cultural impact of data
representations, Viégas and Wattenberg [300] have reviewed
the field of artistic information visualization to investigate how
artists appropriate and repurpose “scientific” techniques to create data representations. Recently, alongside these attempts to
explore the theoretical foundations of artistic visualization, a
large body of work consisting of artistic and often provocative
explorations has received increased attention. An example is
the art installation and performance piece: All The People Of
The World (see Figure 4), which uses single grains of rice arranged in mountains, to represent the world’s population, with
one grain for each person. Individual piles of rice represent
various data sets, such as the deaths in The Holocaust or the
population of the United Kingdom. The creators consider this
work of art not to be merely a representation of data, but also
envisage it as helping people to engage in the critical issues of
the day and get people to participate, understand, and to feel
moved enough to take action.

3.2.2

Physical Data Representations

While the topic of representing data beyond the visual modality
has received increased attention lately, there has been a marked
increase in the study and practice of encoding data in the physical and tangible properties of objects (cf. [4] [275]). Contrary to
many assumptions, representing data through physical forms
is not a novel activity. Archaeologists digging in, what was once
known as Mesopotamia (modern day Syria), unearthed clay tokens that are though to have been used by the Sumerians to
represent numerical data. There are also examples of teaching
aids from the 19th and early 20th Century that use physical representations to help their students understand complex scientific problems. However, these are rare and very little attention
was given to this aspect of data representation until Zhao and
Vande Moere [325] first explored the concept of Data Sculpture.
In this work they define data sculpture as a data representation, which posses both artistic and functional qualities, they

43

44

data representation and evaluation

also establish a model of embodiment to analyse the connection between data and representation. Vande Moere followed
up this research by introducing different levels of data physicality, which affect how data is mapped and perceived by human
senses [196]. In recognising the importance of design in the process of data representation, while also supporting and inspiring
future designs, Vande Moere and Patel [198] surveyed a collection of physical data representations, created within the context
of education, and developed a bespoke semiotic model based
on three categories - symbolic, iconic, and indexical2 The concept
of data physicality was also explored in depth by Jansen and
colleagues, who sought to formalize this type of data representation as Physicalization [125] and provide a very clear definition as: “a physical artifact whose geometry or material properties encode data.” [125, p. 3228]. While this work has sought
to provide a boundary for this field of research, others have attempted to construct and describe the theoretical foundations
for the study and practise of Physicalization. Jansen and Dragicevic’s recent work [123] established a framework for visualizations beyond the desktop paradigm (including Physicalization)
to help describe, compare and critique non-screen based data
representations. Although little work has contributed to formation of design principles for Physicalization, Jansen and Hornbæk [124] explored the design of Physicalizations through the
lens of one of Bertin’s Visual Variables (size) and discovered
that people have little difficulty recognising the difference in
height between two solid bars. However, when they explored
how people perceive the difference in volume between two
spheres, they found that people had a lot of difficulty judging
the difference. Other work that has compared the perception
of data represented in 2D or 3D formats includes Dwyer’s examination of 3D visualizations verses equivalent printouts [55]
and Cockburn and McKenzie [42] who compared physical representations (2D, 2.5D and 3D) with virtual versions.
The work I described above explores aspects of physical data
representation from a theoretical perspective, there are, however, many practitioners who have created physical data representations. In the following I describe some of these examples,
starting first by introducing my own work.

2 While Vande Moere and Patel’s model uses the same categories as Charles
Sanders Peirce’s (1839–1914) model of the sign, they are unrelated.

3.2 data representation

Figure 5: Emigration from Ireland 1987-2013. (a) Traditional Representation (Bar Graph), (b) Physicalization (laser cut MDF
wood), (c) Raw Data (source: Central Statistics Office of Ireland).

In the early stages of my PhD I sought to explore the potential of representing data through the tangible and tactile properties of physical objects. As part of this I created a series of
physical data representations, which represent different socioeconomic data from Ireland. ?? shows one example from the
series, which was created from data gathered from the Central Statistics Office (CSO) of Ireland showing the number of
people who have emigrated from Ireland over the period 19872013. The data was processed using spread sheet and vector
drawing software and then wooden disks were cut by laser and
assembled by pushing a wooden rod through a hole cut in each
disk. Figure 5 shows three views of the source data: (a) a traditional representation of the data set using a bar graph, (b) a
physicalization of the data, and (c) the raw data collected from
CSO. The purpose of creating these objects was to encourage
people to reflect on the economic, social and cultural implications that surround the conceived dataset in an interesting and
unique manner. It was envisaged that the physical representations would be the immediate object of interest; however as people examine the form of the object through touch, they would

45

46

data representation and evaluation

think beyond the object towards the topic of the data source.

reed, wood, data. Dimensions: 36”x36”x36’, © Nathalie
Miebach, 2008. Included here by permission.

Another example of other work that has sought to represent
data through physical artefacts include the intricate data sculptures by Nathalie Miebach (see Figure 6). Exemplifying the use
of archived static data, this series uses environmental data collected from Herring Cove Beach, Cape Cod, USA to explore
“the relationship between barometric pressure, cloud cover, soil
temperature readings and bird sightings”. This hanging structure can be viewed from many angles, but due to its delicate
nature, no further engagement is afforded to the viewer. So, unlike the physicalization of emigration data (Figure 5) the viewers of this piece must imagine how it feels instead of touching
it.
An example that actively encourages people to touch is Strata
Bench (see Figure 7) by data artist and furniture designer, Adrien
Segal. Although Strata Bench is considered to be a work of art,

3.2 data representation

Segal incorporates many scientific and technical processes into
the creation of her work. The approach she takes is also different from the two previous examples. Instead of collecting
raw data and transforming this into physical objects, Segal often sources data representations, such as geo-visualizations and
uses the patterns found in these visualizations to sculpt the
contours of the wood. In essence, the work she creates is a
representation-of-a-representation, however, it can still be considered to be a physicalization as the data is faithfully encoded
into, for instance the patterns that appear on the wood.
3.2.3

Auditory Representations

Using sound to represent data is not a novel phenomenon, from
the audible clicks of a Geiger counter that represent the number of ionization events, over the visceral beeps of an electrocardiogram (ECG) that represent the heart’s electrical activity,
to sound events on a computer that represent, for example, the
arrival of a new email, we have all experienced or can imagine
the sounds of data. However, it is only relatively recently that a
concerted effort from the scientific community started to investigate the representational and perceptual properties of sound.
Gregory Kramer’s book, Auditory Display: Sonification, Audification, and Auditory Interfaces [143] is widely acclaimed as
a landmark publication in auditory display and design. In it
Kramer defines and discusses, for the first time, Information
Sonification (or simply Sonification) as the use of non-speech
audio to convey information or perceptualise data. He also introduces a number of methods and techniques for the practical
application of sonic data representation and discusses a number of approaches to mapping data to sound parameters such
as timbre, tempo, pitch, and loudness. Since then, research has
shown many benefits of auditory data representation. Apart
from the obvious benefit of the user’s hands and eyes being free
to process visual or physical data representations, while hearing a different set of data, sonifications have also been shown to
facilitate the perception of multiple data simultaneously [219],
allow for the perception of subtle changes in values and illuminating gradual changes [63], and it offers a way to expand
the limited possibilities of representing multivariate data with
graphics [146]. There have, however, been studies that highlight
certain disadvantages associated with sonification, such as placing large demands on working memory and the large amount

47

48

of time required to navigate large data sets [303].
Much like InfoVis, Sonification is a distinct field of research
dedicated to the study and practise of representing data through
a single modality (in this case sound). And while Sonification
emerged at a similar time to InfoVis (early 1990’s), it has not
received as much attention as InfoVis. My observations of this
field reveal a number of reasons for this. First, building sonifications is technically more difficult that visualizations, also, unlike InfoVis, there are very few agreed principles for the design
of sonifications [144] [3] [9], and finally it can be argued that
the study of sonification suffers from a lack of historical precedence’s that allowed InfoVis to flourish soon after it was established. Another argument as to why sonification has struggled
to match the recent enthusiasm that surrounds InfoVis may lie
in its use as an augmentation to other modalities, in an attempt
to improve the perceptual qualities of visual or haptic representations. Apart from some notable examples – (cf. [218] [12] [56]),
the majority of research relates to how sound can be combined
with other modalities. The bulk of this research is also spread
across many disciplines and thus sonification has become, what
some may argue to be, a marginalised field of enquiry that is
overly reliant on other modalities to garnish attention from the
wider scientific community. The reason for this may be due

3.2 data representation

49

to dispersed research community. Unlike InfoVis, which is nurtured by a vibrant and popular international annual conference
(IEEE VIS3 ) and a dedicated periodical- IEEE Transactions on
Visualization and Computer Graphics4 , there is no such counterpart for the sonification research community. Following a
comprehensive review of the available literature I identified
three primary research areas that sonification has been used
are: Augmenting visualizations, Assistive technology, and the Arts.
3.2.3.1

Augmenting Visualizations

Numerous studies have shown the benefit of augmenting visualizations with sound to enhance the perceptual qualities of
the representation. Ferguson and colleagues [63] demonstrated
how sound can complement visualizations by highlighting subtle or gradual changes and emphasizing anomalies and outliers
in the representational output. In the context of geo-visualizations,
Krygier [146] explored the potential of using sound as a design
variable and showed how it provides system designers with
more choices for representing ideas and phenomena. Krygier
specifically identified five ways of integrating sound into visualizations, such as (1) a vocal narration, (2) as a means of
detecting anomalies, (3) to reduce visual distraction, (4) as a
substitute for visual patterns, and (5) as a means of adding nonvisual data dimensions [146, p.149]. Also within the domain of
geo-visualization, Harding and colleagues [90] integrated novel
sonification techniques with visualization and force feedback
to assist the user to explore data represented within a multisensory three-dimensional visualization. Wheless and colleagues[312]
also integrated sound into a virtual environment to improve
the perception of the data. They used sound to represent numerically data, by mapping the change in values to the pitch in
sound. Fisher [65] also used the pitch properties of dynamically
generated sounds to represent aspects of a visualization. While
these examples explore the potential of combining sound with
the visual modality, other studies have compared the effectiveness of each modality at conveying certain data characteristics.
Over the course of two studies Flowers and colleagues [68] [67]
found no significant differences between the ability of participants to extract information from multimodal representations,
using either the visual or auditory modality.

3.2.3.2

Assistive Technology

Assistive technology is an umbrella term that refers to any device or system that helps improve the functional capacity of
people with disabilities. Research on the use of sound to assist
people with visual impairments has been on going since the
end of the 1960’s. Commonly known as “sensory substitution”,
this field of research aims to transform or substitute modalities
linked to one sensory mode (e. g.vision) into the modality of
another mode (e. g.audio)5 . More recently, research in this area
has included augmented systems (e.g. visualization and sonification) as well as traditional systems that completely substitute
one modality for another. Aligned with technical developments
in microcontrollers and actuators, there has also been a resurgence in this field, especially related to the representation of
data through non-visual modalities. While the majority of recent research has focused on tactile displays (cf. [303] [136] [29],
audio displays have also played an important role. An example
of research that have sought to investigate the use of sound
to help visually impaired users perceive and understand data
visualizations is Zhao and colleagues work [324] who investigated the use of sound to represent statistical data for visually
impaired users. In a study conducted using geographic data,
they found that auditory feedback allowed for the recognition
of patterns as well as helping the users to navigate maps. Lastly
I note the work of McGookin and colleagues, who studied how
hybrid virtual visualizations and sonification can help visually
impaired users read data graphs and charts [184]. All these are
examples of work that exploits the auditory modality to augment or substitute other modalities with the specific aim of
making data accessible to those who cannot see visual representations of data.
3.2.3.3 The Arts
Another domain that has recently sought to exploit the properties of sound to create representations of data is Digital Art.
While artistic representations of data are typically rendered visually (see [313] and [300] for examples and further discussion)
recent work has broadened the perceptual bandwidth by integrating sonification as well as other modalities. This field of
artistic endeavour is commonly known today as Data Art [171]
or Artistic Data Visualization [300] and came into prominence
5 see [158] for a detailed discussion of sensory substitution

following the rise of Information Visualization. While many reasons for to the growth in Data Art are comparable to InfoVis,
such as, the mainstreaming of computer graphics, the democratization of data sources, and access to and distribution of the
Internet, a motivating factor, which has be argued to be unique
to Data Art is data becoming part of the cultural discourse [300,
p.185]. Whitelaw [313] also addresses this point in his discourse
on the practise of Data Art – “In the process of working pragmatically with data - using it as a generative resource, a way
of making - data art is involved in the culturally crucial figuration of data and its contemporary domain” [313, p.1]. This
is also reflected in the role data artists play in society, unlike
designers of information visualizations, who have traditionally
focused on task-driven concerns, data artists often disregard
practical functionality and instead seek to facilitate the expression of some underlying message extrinsic to the data and provoking personal reflection [76] [154].
Artistic creations that typify this motivation and also integrate sound to communicate a message from the data source

51

include, Listening Post(2000-2001), Cloud Piano (2014), and Sonicity (2010).
listening post (see Figure 8) is an art installation created
by statistician Mark Hansen and experimental sound artist Ben
Rubin. Described by Hansen and Rubin as an exploration of
the “information hidden in data” [87], Listening Post is made
up of a series of visualizations and sonifications, which represent real-time conversations on the World Wide Web. The type
of data used in Listening Post is raw text, which is scrapped
from thousands of real-time conversations happening in chat
rooms, forums, newsgroups, bulletin boards, and other public online communication channels. This data is then analysed
and organised into topics based on the content. An arched wall,
comprising of hundreds of small screens display the dynamic
text, and digital-generated monotone voices, overlapping, or in
strange harmonies, verbalise the text for the audience. While
the visual impact of the installation is very striking, the creators of Listening Post emphasise the important role of sound
in the installation – “the visual component of Listening Post
acts as a kind of ventriloquist’s dummy, which is animated by
our sonic design” [88].
cloud piano (see Figure 9) is a sound installation created
by digital artist David Bowen and driven by data collected from

3.2 data representation

real-time cloud shapes and movements. The installation comprises of a piano, whose keys are actuated by robotic armature.
The articulation of each key is controlled by custom software
that is linked to a live video feed captured by a camera located
outside of the building. When the program detects a cloud entering an area of the frame it triggers the robot to press the
corresponding key, thus, he tempo and rhythm of the piece is
determined by how quickly the clouds are moving. While some
may consider this to be generative music, David Bowen notes
that he “never really thought of it as music...I’ve always thought
of it as a sound installation more than anything”, a sound installation that is controlled by the randomness of cloud cover
on any given day [274].
sonicity (see Figure 10) is a sound installation created by
British artist Stanza, which is made from the data collected
across different cities. The piece integrates a number of environmental sensors that monitors the space (the building) and the
environment (the city) where the installation is located. These
sensors capture real-time ambient data (light, temperature, noise,
and humidity), which is processed to produce a sonification
of the micro incidents of change that occur around the installation over time. The technology used to collect the data for
this artwork is very similar to that used by scientists who create geo-visualizations. However, the motivation and representational format is very different, while data scientists may create
representations to reveal patterns in environmental conditions
and also to predict future events, Stanza considers Sonicity to
be a new way of exploring and “thinking about interaction
within public space and how this affects the socialization of
space.” [270].
3.2.4

Other Modalities

While the representational modalities discussed already have
a relatively long historical tradition of investigation and practise (ranging from decades to hundreds of years), the remaining modalities (taste and smell) have received far less attention
from the scientific and art community. This is mainly due to
the innate technical difficulties in producing and controlling
the output from these modalities. Beyond this, other challenges
include (1) producing specific tastes or odours on demand, (2)
delivering the taste or odour stimuli to the user, and (3) elimi-

53

54

data representation and evaluation

nating the taste or odour when required [10, p.129]. Investigating olfactory displays in HCI research can be traced back to
Kaye [134], this work explored the use of computerized scent
output as a medium to generate data insight. Kaye postulated
that the affordances of this modality are best suited to “slowmoving, medium-duration data, rather than rapidly changing
information” [134, p.60]. He also noted that the associations
we draw from smells varies dramatically, so the meaning one
person (or culture) attributes to a certain smell may be entirely
different from someone else. While modalities other than smell
can be influenced by the cultural and past experiences of individuals, Kaye states that these are heightened for smell.
Studies have shown the value of using olfactory stimuli in
scenarios such as sensory substitution, conveying alerts, stimulate emotional responses and increasing recall [301] [141] [40] [47].
Although these studies were conducted across many disciplines,
all have strong associations with the study and design data representations. Representing data through smell is still in its infancy, however, there are some examples in the literature. Dollars & Scents is an olfactory display that represents fluctuations
in the stock market by releasing scents into the air, such as rose,
when the market is rising, and lemon when it is contracting
(for more details, see [133]. Also, Smell Maps is a participatory
project ran by artist and designer, Kate McLean. The project
involves a group of people partaking in ’smellwalks’ around
cities, exploring the different aromas emanating from the city
environment. Based on this experience the participants fill out
information that describes the different aromas, the data is then
collated and Kate produces a smell map of the city, which comprises of olfactory cues and visualizations.
Lastly, I discuss gustatory or taste displays. Much like olfactory, the information transmission capability of the gustatory
sense is still largely unknown [10]. For the most part, the challenges facing the use of the olfactory sense for data interpretation also apply to the gustatory modality. While we all can
recall when a certain taste evoked memories of a past event
(e.g. the taste of candy as an adult stimulating childhood memories), controlling and delivering these taste is hugely problematic for olfactory displays. There are, however, some rare,
but intriguing, examples including, BeanCounter [177] by Dan
Maynes-Aminzade who was one of the first to explore this

3.2 data representation

Figure 10: Sonicity by Stanza © 2014

space and introduce the concept of Edible User Interface (EUI).
BeanCounter consists of a rack of six hollow transparent vertical
rods, each filled with different flavoured jellybeans. The system
monitors activity on a local network and whenever a packet is
sent across the network on one of the monitored ports, a jellybean of the corresponding flavour drops into a bowl for those
who are passing by to taste.
Another example that uses food to represent data is Data Cuisine. This initiative, led by data researcher and practicing artist,
Moritz Stefaner, consists of workshops where the participants
explore food as a means of data representation or as Stefaner
refers to it as – “edible diagrams” [271]. To date there have
been five workshops, held in Helsinki, Barcelona, Berlin, Basel
and Leeuwarden. One dish (data representation) produced during the Barcelona workshop is First Date Noodles created by the
team at Domestic Data Streamers6 . First Date Noodles (see Figure 11) is a representation of the sexual behaviour of young
people from Barcelona. The dish consists of two portions of
noodles, the straight ones represent the population who would
abstain from sex on a first date and the ’noodle ball’ for the others. The gender of the sample is represented by the colour of
the noodles (male: blue, female: pink). An issue that is not clear
from the creator’s description is whether the different portions
of noodles are infused with different flavours. If not, then the
viewer is only required to use their sense of sight and touch

to interpret the data, thus this piece would be considered as
a visualization or physicalization and not a gustatory or taste
displays. This anomaly, however, is not reflective of the majority
of examples I have reviewed. In general Data Cuisine communicates information through a combination of taste, smell, sight
and touch, in what some may argue to be an almost holistic
sensual experience of data.
3.2.5

Section Summary

In this section, I have described the various representational
modalities commonly used to represent data. From here, I move
on to describe various approaches and methods used to evaluate data representations, paying particular attention to qualitative approaches.
3.3

data evaluation

To date, the majority of published research on the evaluation
of data representations is situated within the field of InfoVis
and predominantly addresses questions regarding user performance, usability, and visualization algorithms. Studies that shed
light into more open-ended questions regarding insight, discov-

3.3 data evaluation

ery and experiences with information visualizations are relatively rare (cf. [150]). One possible reason for this may be attributed to the traditional application area of information visualization. Until recently, the vast majority of information visualizations were designed to support analytical tasks for expert
users.
Today, however, visualizations are frequently used in more
informal settings ranging from casual scenarios [233], storytelling [260], museum display [100], personal reminiscing [283],
browsing for personal interest or edutainment [17] [100] [284],
and community-driven urban scenarios [15]. Another reason
why there is little work that aims at studying subjective experiences with visualizations is that we still lack evaluation methods that can derive reliable and rich data on insight generation,
discoveries and experience.
When I talk about experience in this context, I mean personal
responses to a data representation, which goes beyond interaction and usability aspects to focus on capturing hedonistic, emotional, and sensory responces to the representation as well as personal interpretations, meaning, and opinions that it may trigger.
Capturing people’s subjective experiences in a scientific way is
a challenge. Apart from the fact that people find it inherently
difficult to describe their experiences, it is also difficult for the
researcher to validate these accounts due to issues such as posthoc rationalization and humans innate desire to embellish accounts with details that did not occur during the original experience. The commonly used techniques that capture accounts of
people’s experiences and exploration processes have strengths
and weaknesses. More rigid and controlled methods, such as
questionnaires and Likert Scales lead to more objective but less
rich results. More open-ended methods, such as observations,
diaries, think-aloud, and interviews provide a rich account of
people’s subjective experience but allow for bias introduced by
the researcher or participant. This may be the reason why there
is little work that aims at studying subjective experiences with
visualization beyond, processes of analysis, reasoning, knowledge discovery and communication [150].
While fields of research traditionally associated with the study
of data representation, such as Information Visualization has
not yet fully embraced experience research as an important as-

57

58

data representation and evaluation

pect of design, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), has a long
tradition in this area. The shift from evaluating performance to
researching experience has stimulated a rich discourse in HCI,
around topics such as hedonics [93], affect [323], empathy [320],
and enchantment [181]. There has also been work to extend
the traditional measures of performance in HCI, which up to
recently included aspects such as efficiency and effectiveness.
Löwgren [165] proposed a list of use qualities by exploring other
designers’ reflections, published empirical studies, and design
critiques, combined with his own first-hand design experience,
with the aim of helping interaction designer’s kick-start the design process and communicate design decisions to stakeholders.
The use qualities Löwgren proposes combine aspects that were
already employed in HCI, such as efficiency and transparency,
with newly proposed ones such as relevance, fluency, pliability,
actability, surprise and elegance.
3.3.1

Describing a lived experience

Gaining an understanding of people’s experiences as well as
extending the focus of evaluation may not reveal details about
specific design elements. However, it does allow us to investigate how systems shape the way people feel and think as they
interpret and/or interact with them. This knowledge can be
used to reflect more effectively upon design decisions. As outlined in the introduction of this thesis, the primary aim of my
research is to investigate and describe people’s subjective experience with data representations. To accomplish this I need to
capture precise accounts of people’s lived experience with data
representations.
In the following I discuss commonly used approaches, methods and techniques, which have been used to study how people
interact, perceive and interpret systems, including those that
represent data. Studying people’s experience of data representations is typically situated in the field of InfoVis and thus the
bulk work I reference emerged from this field. With that said,
the methods utilised by these researchers are generally borrowed from other fields. Most of the methods I discuss here
are proven and commonly used methods within the HCI research community, however, their use and efficacy has been
questioned in the context of evaluating data representations
(cf. [32]).

3.3 data evaluation

3.3.2

Studying Experiences of Data Representation

While evaluation has been a significant aspect of HCI since
its inception, its role within InfoVis research has only become
prominent relatively recently. Previous literature describes a
range of techniques that can be applied to studying different aspects of visualization systems [36] [201] [150]. Carpendale [36]
provides a thorough overview of quantitative and qualitative
methods applicable to InfoVis, outlining their strengths and
weaknesses. Munzner discusses evaluation methods focusing
on the different stages of the visualization design process [201].
Lam and colleagues [150] identified seven InfoVis evaluation
scenarios, including those that focus on understanding the data
analysis process and those that aim at deepening our understanding of visualization techniques. Based on these, they provide an overview of possible evaluation goals, questions, and
methods to facilitate the study design process.
Common evaluation techniques that are used to investigate
how people form insight, make discoveries and subjectively experience systems and their individual features include observations, diaries, questionnaires, think-aloud procedures, and interviews (see Table 2 for a summary of their strengths and limitations). All these techniques are not necessarily specific to the
study of data representation, but have been used in this context
to explore analysis processes, the usability and (more rarely)
subjective experiences with systems. In the following sections I
discuss these methods and outline pertinent issues that affect
the validity and accurateness of the data gathered.
3.3.2.1

Observation

Observational studies have a long tradition in qualitative research (cf. [170]). This approach was first used in anthropology,
but was soon employed by sociologists and more recently it has
become a commonly used method in HCI research [6]. Observational studies may take place in any setting in which people
have complex interactions with each other, with objects or with
their physical environment, however, in the context of HCI they
typically take place ‘in the wild’, where the ‘wild’ may be the
workplace, home, or some other location where the activity of
interest takes place, that is, the technology of interest is used.
The practice of observing people involved in technology-based
activities is considered to be a valuable method for gathering

rich descriptions [237].
In the context of studying people’s engagement with data
representations, observational studies are a common method
to evaluate how people interact and experience these systems.
The direct observation of people’s interactions with a visualization, for instance, through in-situ field notes or video recordings, can provide insights into the analysis process and experience with the system. Observational studies can also be conducted in a laboratory setting or in-situ [36]. The researcher
simply watches and takes notes on how people interact with
the visualization, what kind of activities they engage in, what
data aspects they explore and what visual elements they use
(see [100] and [284] for example studies). Sometimes, interactions are video-recorded and/or computationally logged by the
visualization system to allow for a more in-depth analysis of
participant’s interactions. The observation of people’s activities
around a data representation can provide insights into their
general analysis process and experience with the system. However, a qualitative interpretation of observations is necessary
but can introduce bias [36]. Furthermore, pure observation does
not offer direct insights into participant’s thought processes
and experiences; important aspects that can only be contributed
by the person interacting with the visualization may be missed.
3.3.2.2

Interviews

Interviews are one of the most common ways of gathering
insights into people’s past experiences. Much like ethnography and observational studies, the use of interviewing as a
method of collecting data had a long tradition in other domains, such as psychology and sociology, prior to being used
in HCI research. The use of interviews as a formal method in
empirical research can be traced back to the development of
the focused interview by Robert Merton and his colleagues in
the mid-1940’s [190]. Since then, many variations on interviewing have emerged, including semi-structured interviews [258], unstructured interviews [70], problem-centered interviews [319], the
expert interview [191], and the ethnographic interview [269]. The
most common forms of interviewing techniques used in HCI research today are unstructured, structured and semi-structured,
and the choice of with approach to adopt typically depends on
the evaluation goals and the research question. For instance, if
the goal is to gain an understanding of people’s response to a

61

62

data representation and evaluation

new design, then an unstructured interview is often the best
approach. Whereas, if the purpose of the study is to probe people about a specific design feature, then a structured interview
is probably a better option.
In the context of studying data representations, interviews
are typically conducted to gather first-hand opinions of participants after they have interacted with a visualization system [284], or to learn about existing work strategies to inform
the design of a visualization system. The data acquired during
an interview can be rich in insights, going beyond potential
pre-assumptions of the interviewer and superficial opinions of
the participant. However, while interviews are frequently conducted to evaluate information visualizations, the type and interview approach is rarely specified when reporting on the
study. In the context of studying data representations, interview
questions have traditionally focused on usability aspects and do
not explore actual experiences and insight generation processes.
Admittedly, these latter aspects are difficult to capture in an
interview—without introducing bias and post-rationalization.
Similar to questionnaires, interviews typically involve a list of
pre-defined questions but, in contrast to questionnaires, they
have the advantage that the interviewer can flexibly adapt to
participants’ statements and comments, modifying or asking
follow-up questions during the interview. If used correctly, the
data acquired during an interview can be rich in insights, going
beyond potential pre-assumptions of the interviewer and superficial opinions of the participant. However, interviews also contain bias, introduced by leading questions from the interviewer
or by the participant who may be influenced by a subconscious
desire to align to the interviewer’s anticipations (demand characteristic effects [48].
Furthermore, a commonly known problem with interviews
is people tend to post-rationalize their activities and experiences, in that they often report what they believe or imagine
they were doing at the time, instead of what they were actually
doing. To overcome this and other issues some researchers have
sought to conduct a retrospective interview while showing the
interviewee a video recording of their interactions (cf. [236]).
Video-recall can increase the accuracy of the described experience while also reminding the interviewee of details that would
have otherwise been forgotten. However, as it is a fundamental

3.3 data evaluation

requirement to have the original event video reordered, this
limits the study situations and settings this method can be applied to; it usually means that the study has to be conducted
in a laboratory or similar setting. Furthermore, watching the
video during the interview can also influence the description
or accounts of the experience. For instance, watching the event
unfold on video can stimulate new thoughts that were not evident during the original experience.
3.3.2.3

Questionnaires

Questionnaires are a common way to collect information about
people’s subjective experience with a system, both in controlled
laboratory settings as well as field studies. In contrast to interviews, for example, questionnaires are a powerful way of
collecting data about people’s experiences with a system on a
large scale; they can be handed out to many people and made
available over a long period of time. This can be useful for largescale evaluations in public settings such as museums [100]. Typical ways of eliciting people’s experiences with a system in form
of a questionnaire are Likert Scales and/or open-ended questions [163]. Named after its inventor, psychologist Rensis Likert,
this method requires study participants to rate their experience
with a system on a (five- or seven-point) quantitative scale. This
approach produces quantitative data on participant’s subjective
experience, which makes it easy to compare, for instance, different systems or groups of participants. However, Likert Scales
reduce rich subjective experience to pre-defined categories; important details and subtleties of people’s experiences may not
be captured. In addition, they do not reflect the reasons for
participant’s ratings. Open-ended questions can be included
into questionnaires to allow participants to describe their experiences in their own words, hence, resulting in rich accounts
of (sometimes unanticipated) experiences. However, the level of
detail that participants provide through open-ended questions
can vary dramatically. Furthermore, statements may be ambiguous and, depending on the study setting, it may not be possible
to ask the participant to clarify their comments.
3.3.2.4

Diaries

Diaries can provide rich data about the analysis process, the
role of the system in this process, and discoveries from an individual participant perspective as part of longitudinal stud-

63

64

data representation and evaluation

ies [75] [19]. The use of documents for study has a long tradition in qualitative research; for example, diaries can be seen as
traces of personal experiences or records interactions [66]. First
used in Cognitive Science research (cf. [206]), diaries were subsequently introduced to the HCI community in the early 1990’s
through Kirakowski and Corbett’s book on HCI methods [138].
One of the first HCI empirical studies to use diaries was by John
Rieman [242]. In the context of HCI, diaries are used to capture
activities that occur in the everyday lives of participants and
sometimes used as part of a cultural probe study (cf. [77]). During diary studies participants are provided with objects to use
in their everyday lives and are asked to regularly record their
insights and experiences using a written diary. Although the
entries in diaries are usually recorded in written format, there
have been examples of studies that have provided participants
with technology to record their interactions. Browne and colleagues used diaries to collect data on the different strategies
people employ when capturing information, such as pen and
paper, sounds, images and notes [28]. In this study participants
were provided with a camera and were asked to take a picture
every time they captured information in any form. Palen and
Salzman’s study [214] also provided participants with technology to make records of their daily activities, but in this case
each participant was asked to used mobile and landline telephony to make voice-mails instead of writing on paper.
Diaries can also provide a rich picture of people’s analysis
process using systems, their experience as part of the process,
as well as resulting discoveries and insights (and, possibly their
meaning for the participant). However, paper based diaries rely
heavily on participants commitment to regular diary keeping,
and the consistency of written accounts may vary or change
over time (e.g., the level of detail may decrease over time). Also,
the participant may introduce personal biases in form of postrationalization [221], a common problem when it comes to eliciting accounts of personal experiences.
3.3.2.5

The Think-Aloud Protocol

Another method used to elicit people’s experience, which has
been regularly used in HCI research since the 1980’s is the
Think-Aloud protocol. Early work by Newell and Simon [203] is
often cited as a major landmark in bringing about its wider acceptance, although various works by Ericsson and Simon (cf.[57]

3.3 data evaluation

[58]) are more commonly referenced. The Think-Aloud protocol can help to extract information about people’s experiences
with interactive systems in-situ, which may quickly fade away
after the interaction [57] [162]. Several researchers have argued
that the think-aloud protocol can help to identify the cognitive processes responsible for people’s behavior and actions
that may not be visible otherwise [130] [84]. However, thinkingaloud is not a process that people naturally engage in. The activity of commenting on thoughts and actions (as they occur)
adds a cognitive task and, hence, can skew people’s experience
of their exploration process and their experience with the system or data representation in general [36] [221] [220]. Furthermore, the addition of thinking-aloud as an extra task can lower
participant’s awareness of how and why they explore certain
aspects of the system.
3.3.2.6 Focus Groups
Focus groups have been in use since the middle of the 21st century. Originally called focus interviews, they were used by social scientists to examine the morale of the U.S. military during
World War Two. Although the technique has been widely used
in market research, difficulties in demonstrating rigor in analysis and fear of researcher bias meant that the technique was
not fully embraced by HCI research until the 1980’s [45]. Focus
groups can be conducted at various stages of a research project,
during the preliminary or exploratory stages of a study or as a
method of evaluation. Their main purpose is to obtain perceptions on a defined area of interest in a natural, non-threatening
environment. Most importantly, for researchers interested in exploring user-experience, the data that gathered is qualitative,
and consists of experiences, opinions, ideas, and motivations
for behaviour, rather than “figures and facts” [200]. Mazza and
Berre first proposed using focus group studies in the context
of InfoVis to evaluate techniques and tools [179]. They claim
that focus groups offer researchers an insight into why certain
visualizations work or not and can be used to “uncover potential problems and suggest improvements that would not have
been revealed with other analytic and empirical evaluation techniques” [179, p.80]. Although Mazza and Berre highlight the
positive aspects of using focus group studies, there are also
problems associated with this technique, including, difficulties
in arriving at a consensus, no agreed method of analysis and it

65

66

data representation and evaluation

may become dominated by assertive and vocal individuals.
Focus groups also offer design researchers a flexible technique that can be employed at various stages of the design
cycle—to elicit user needs, for feedback on concept sketches
or prototypes, or to let participants generate new ideas. Focus
groups can also be used for final concept refinement. Tremblay and colleagues [286] highlight several reasons why focus
groups is a highly relevant and rigorous approach for refining and evaluating design artefacts, these include, its ability to
allow for the emergence of ideas or opinions that are not usually uncovered in individual interviews, and offering design
researchers the opportunity to collect large amounts of rich
data. They also help to reveal information in a way which allows researchers to find out why an issue is salient, as well as
what is salient about it [200]. Focus groups are also a very efficient form of exploration and evaluation, however, because of
their open approach, a skilled, unbiased moderator is needed to
mediate and refocus conversations. Another known issue with
focus groups is the lack of clear procedures that could guide
newcomers to the approach [2]. Nevertheless, focus groups are
widely used in HCI, and often in combination with other approaches (cf. [178] [30]).
3.4

chapter summary

The aim of this chapter was to provide a review of the state-ofthe-art in data representation and evaluation. To achieve this I
first presented a brief history of data representation, focusing at
times on important milestones that have influenced the trajectory of the field. I then showed how data representation today
is not exclusively visual by pointing to a surge in research dedicated to the study of representational modalities beyond the
visual modality. Each of these modalities: physical, auditory,
olfactory and gustatory posses their own unique characteristics that can be used to communicate information and facilitate data insight. While research on representational modalities
other than visual is still relatively new, there is now a growing
community of researchers who strive to exploit their full potential.
I also reviewed current practises in evaluating data representations, drawing primarily on examples from InfoVis. A review

3.4 chapter summary

of the literature shows that the study of data representation is
skewed toward evaluating traditional usability concerns, such
as effectiveness and efficiency and the methods used are typically quantitative. There have, however, been some studies that
have attempted to explore issues more closely related to the
focus of my research – experience. Studying people’s experience of data representations is a difficult task, which is made
even more difficult by the lack of proven or accepted methods within InfoVis. Up to now, InfoVis researchers have borrowed qualitative methods from HCI and applied them to the
study of data representation, these include: observational studies, diaries, questionnaires, the think-aloud protocol and interviews. While these methods have been relatively successful at
revealing issues related to the experience of systems, they have
limitations. To overcome the limitations associated with these
methods, in Part Two of this thesis, I introduce two methods
(the Repetory Grid and Elicitation interview technique), which
have yet to be used in the study of data representation, but
allow for the elicitation of participants meaning structures of
events/artefacts and for the capture of precise accounts of experience. Before then, in the next chapter, I draw together the
three theoretical aspects discussed so far – phenomenology, representation and evaluation – by presenting a phenomenological
informed design and evaluation study.

introduction

In Chapter 2, I presented Phenomenology as the philosophical foundations of my research approach; this was followed
in Chapter 3 with an overview of the state-of-the-art in data
representation and evaluation. I now draw these three aspects
together in the form of a design exercise and analysis of datadriven prototypes in use.
I start this chapter with an overview of the background to
this project and introduce two prototypes that were created
to represent scientific data to a casual audience. These prototypes were designed to be deployed in a public Space Observatory, where a series of user studies were conducted. I used
these studies to better understand how people experienced the
data represented through the prototypes. I conclude by interrogating the prototypes in use through the prism of philosophical thought by Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice
Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde, as I apply phenomenological theories and ideas to the exploration of people’s experience of tangible data representation 1
4.2

background

The prototypes I introduce here are: H3 (see Figure 12, B) and
the Solar Radiation Dowsing Rod (see Figure 13, A), which
1 The design and implementation of the prototypes presented in this chapter (H3 and the Solar Radiation Dowsing rod) has already been described
in [101]. In this publication we primarily described the prototypes and only
discussed some observations, here I extend the discussion and analysis of
participant reactions, and also discuss the prototypes from the perspective
of philosophical phenomenology.

were designed to be deployed in Blackrock Castle Observatory,
Cork, Ireland—a working Space Observatory that also contains
a museum that is open to the public. H3 is a small hand held
devise that represents the levels of Hydrogen in deep space,
which is captured by a nearby radio telescope (see Figure 13,
A). The user triggers H3 to represent the data by shaking the
cube, this gesture causes an embedded microcontroller to request the latest reading from the telescope and once this is
received H3 it represents the data through vibration. The Solar Radiation Dowsing Rod also represents astrological data,
which are the levels of solar radiation captured by a motorised
radio telescope situated on the roof of the Observatory (see Figure 12, B). The user can point the rod in the air and once he/she
selects the heading, this is sent to the telescope, which in turn
points in the same direction and scans for solar radiation levels. The telescope then sends this data back to the rod, which
causes vibrations based on the intensity of the radiation.

4.3

design concept

The overarching design concept that underpins the creation
of both prototypes was to offer casual users the opportunity
to interact with complex scientific data in a natural and intuitive manner. The data, which both prototypes represent, is not
normally presented to a lay public audience; instead, it is utilized by experts to analyse certain phenomenon in the solar
system and deep space. The goal of the design process was to

4.3 design concept

create prototypes that would facilitate non-analytical data insight using tangible interfaces. I envisaged the prototypes not
to be replacements for traditional information visualizations,
but to compliment the range of tools available when representing data to the wider population. This project was a collaboration with Blackrock Castle Space Observatory and the Irish National Space Centre, who provided me with access to scientific
live data as well as a public exhibition context. In the design of
both prototypes I prioritised three aspects: the type of user, the
modality of the representation, and the mode of interaction.
The prototypes were designed to generate curiosity and awareness of the represented data, as well as acting as a compliment to more traditional information displays located in the observatory, which use text, motion graphics and imagery. They
were also designed to be crossmodal representations by encoding data in vibro-tactile and auditory feedback simultaneously. Unlike multimodal representations, where each modality is used to transmit a different type of information, crossmodal representations use different modalities to present the
same data [158]. As an everyday example of a crossmodal display, most of us recognize the sensation of being alerted to an
incoming call or SMS on our mobile phones through sounds
while also vibrating.
A key feature envisioned in the design process was how users
would interact with the data. Based on the notion of embodied
interaction [52] [111] [153], I explored various ways of promoting the physicality of the interaction as well as exploring body
motion and spatiality to free the representation from the traditional screen based format.
In the early stages of the design process I decided to use two
separate data sources and to develop a unique design concept
for each. One of the sources of the data is a 1.4GHz receiver on
a 32-meter (diameter) radio telescope that measures hydrogen
levels in deep space (see Figure 13, A). The other is a 2.4GHz
receiver on a 2-meter (diameter) radio telescope that reads solar
radiation levels within our solar system (see Figure 12, B).
In regards to the real-time Hydrogen data, I envisaged this to
be perceivable by visitors anywhere within the Observatory. To
facilitate this, I developed a concept that allows visitors to carry

71

72

data, design and dasein

Figure 13: A) 32m Radio Telescope, (B) H3

a data-driven responsive cube with them as they move about.
When the visitor interacts with the cube (by shaking it) the latest Hydrogen levels are displayed through vibration motors embedded in the cube. The intensity of the vibration is mapped to
the levels captured from the telescope (the higher the stronger
the vibration). A core characteristic of this concept is to allow
the visitor to use the device while simultaneously reading information displayed using other modalities (text, video and
imagery) about Hydrogen and other related phenomenon presented throughout the Observatory.
As the telescope that monitors solar radiation levels can be
directed at a specific point in space I sought to offer control of
this functionality to the user as well as representing the data
read by the telescope. To do this I borrowed the metaphor of
a dowsing rod. Traditionally this tool is used to locate underground water sources; it is said that people feel the rod pulling
them towards these sources. The reason I chose this metaphor
is that experts may use the representation of solar radiation
levels as an indicator to locate objects in our solar system. I envisaged the user selecting a position in space by pointing the
rod upwards, and confirming this by pressing a button located
on one of its handles. The coordinates of this heading are sent
to the telescope, which then manoeuvres to point in this direction. Once the telescope has reached the heading it sends the
solar radiation level from this point in the solar system back
to the rod. This triggers the rod to vibrate, with the data value
mapped to the intensity of the vibration (see Figure 14).

data Besides of developing two bespoke data-driven artefacts, I also had to develop a strategy for real-time acquisition of
data from both telescopes, and to communicate this wirelessly
to each device. To acquire the data I utilized the COSM [31]
platform. A custom program on the computer attached to each
telescope collects the latest data and sends it to an account on
COSM. Any computer connected to the Internet can then retrieve this data.
h 3 H3 is a wireless cube (7cm side length) constructed from
semi-opaque Perspex. To perceive the latest hydrogen levels
users gently shake the cube. This action is detected by an accelerometer connected to a microcontroller within the cube. The
microcontroller then sends a request to COSM for the latest
data using a wireless radio frequency module. When this data
is retrieved, it activates four vibrating motors fixed to the internal faces of the cube, which vibrate for four seconds. When
they stop, the user may shake the cube again.
solar radiation dowsing rod When developing the
Solar Radiation Dowsing Rod device I tested numerous types
of wood for the most effective transmission of vibrations and
finally choose ash. Embedded in the wood is an Inertial Measuring Unit (IMU) module (that includes a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope and a compass module), a LED strip (green, red
and orange), a push button and two 5-volt vibration motors.
An armband pack is connected by wires to the rod and contains a microcontroller, a wireless radio frequency module and
a 9v battery. To communicate the latest heading of the dowsing rod, a custom program retrieves the pitch and yaw values
from the IMU and writes these to a text file, which is uploaded
to a server via FTP. A custom script on a computer connected
to the telescope continuously listens for this file to be updated.
Once this happens, the script parses the values and instructs
the motors on the telescope to rotate to this heading. While this
is happening, three orange LEDs flash in sequence to in-form
the user that the telescope is moving. When the telescope has
reached the new heading, it reads the solar radiation levels and
uploads these to the COSM server (see Figure 14 for system design).

4.5 user study

The microcontroller constantly listens for updates on COSM
and once it reads a new value it activates the vibration motors embedded in the rod for four seconds and turns on a red
LED for this time. The duration of time between choosing a
new heading and the vibration commencing depends on the
distance the telescope must rotate; the longest wait is approximately five seconds.
Initially both prototypes were designed to represent the data
through the haptic modality only. However, when I produced
the first prototypes I discovered that distinctive sounds were
a by-product of the vibration of the wood and plastic. When
the vibration motors in H3 spin fast, they produce a loud highpitched sound whereas the soft wood in the rod dampens the
vibration to produce a lighter ’humming’ sound. I believed that
these sounds enhanced the use of the devices and thus explored
numerous techniques before choosing one that produced the
clearest audio feedback.
4.5

user study

To assess the user-experience of the prototypes I presented them
to visitors of Blackrock Castle Observatory, which is open to
the public all year round. Over the course of one week approximately one-hundred visitors used the devices and I conducted observations and some informal interviews with these
visitors. This study did not focus on usability issues; instead
I was more interested in observing people’s interactions with
the prototypes and probing them on how they felt while using
them. In the following, I present this study and elicit some initial observations from the results. I then use the gathered data
again to explore the use of the prototypes through the lens of
phenomenological theories and ideas.
4.5.1

Procedure

Over the course of one-week I attended the Observatory and offered the prototypes to visitors. Those that used the prototypes
ranged in age from 5 to 65 years old. Before visitors began to
use the prototypes, they all signed a consent form; following
this I briefly explained each of the devices. All visitors indicated that they have an interest in Space, however, none had
any prior knowledge of issues related to Hydrogen levels in

75

data, design and dasein

76

deep space or solar radiation levels in the outer atmosphere. I
was onsite at all times to assist the participants and the interactions were captured using video- and audio recording equipment. When appropriate, I asked the visitors about how they
felt and what they were imagining when using the prototypes,
these responses were recorded through field notes.
4.5.2

General User Observations

I observed that users were continuously switching their attention and gaze when interacting with both prototypes. Once
they began to use the dowsing rod, they would look upwards
(away from the device) to aim at a point they sought to target.
On occasions, users looked through the windows to use visual
reference points such as the Sun and Moon when selecting a
heading. Once they confirmed this point (pressed the button),
their attention then moved to the dowsing rod, until it began
to vibrate. At this point they would again gaze upwards at the
point they had chosen. When asked what they felt while they
looked at the dowsing rod, most answered that they were imagining the telescope rotating and felt that they must keep the rod
still while this took place. Whereas, when they looked upwards,
participants indicated that they felt their attention should be focused on where the vibration and sounds are coming from:
“It’s up there somewhere that is making this thing shake and buzz.”
This switch of focus was also observed with users of H3 . As
designed for, the users walked around the observatory, browsing other information about Hydrogen in Space and other related phenomenon (see Fig. 4.4). Although they were able to
interact with the prototype while walking around, when the
device began to vibrate they stood still and did not look at the
device, but continued to read other information. One participant stated:
“That kind of thing [pointing to a printed image of a hydrogen
cloud] feels like this [referring to the vibration of the cube] it sounds
fuzzy but it feels as clear as the image and the sensation stays in your
hands for a while, kind of like an echo”.

4.5 user study

Referring to the connection between H3 and the phenomenon
(data) it represents, another participant remarked:
“It is so weird to think that the buzzing [I feel] in my hands has
been caused by something so far away, and if you really think about
it’s so far away that it doesn’t even exist any more, that is so strange”
While this seems to show that the buzzing feedback feels real
and physically present, participants seem to know (intellectually) how far the source is away, this may make the experience
more memorable then a static graphical representation.
I also observed a high level of social interaction around both
devices. On many occasions the prototypes were the centre of
attention for groups of visitors and in particular families. As
one member of the group interacted with a device, the other
members probed them with questions related to how the experience felt:
P1 Does it hurt?
P2 No it tingles, kinda like an electric shock but nice.
P1 Does it feel stronger than before?
P2 Yes, I think the radiation levels are higher at this part of the sky
P1 You must be pointing at the sun
P2 No I think I would know if I was pointing at the sun, that would
definitely hurt me.
This relates in particular to the vibro-tactile modality, as the
user of the prototype is the only one who can perceive this. On
occasions, groups attempted to share the experience by having
several members touching parts of the device. During these occasions they would compare how they perceived the characteristics of the feedback. When observing families, I noticed both
devises seemed to encourage parents to explain their interpretation of the data to children. Feedback from parents revealed
that using the prototype was an enjoyable experience for all
members of the family because they offered easy access to the
data. One parent remarked:
“Although I know very little about radiation out there, it helped me
explain what I do know to ’L’ [10 year old daughter] when I saw how
excited she was as it buzzed in her hand. Now I have to learn more, to

77

data, design and dasein

78

answer all her questions when we get home.”
Finally, my observations revealed some misconceptions that
people had while using the dowsing rod. On many occasions,
people pointed the rod at objects within the Observatory, such
as computer screens and power supplies, anticipating that these
objects would have high levels of radiation. Also, some people
were reluctant to point in a direction if another person was
in their line-of-sight and rather chose to walk around them to
point at a clear area.
In this section I presented some observations collected during the deployment of the prototypes in the Observatory. In the
next sections I use the data gathered during this study to explore the prototypes use through the lens of philosophical phenomenology. I focus specifically on the theories and ideas by
Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty
and Don Ihde.
4.5.3

Through Husserl

The first concept that I use to explore people’s experience of the
prototypes is Husserl’s theory of Intentionality. Unlike the other
ideas that I will discuss later, this theory does not specifically
relate to the way we experience objects, tools or equipment, instead, it suggests the general structure of human experience. In
Chapter Two, I described Husserl’s theory of Intentionality as:
all human experience involves an activity, and is referential to
something external. Thus, for a critique of people’s experience
of the prototypes we must examine the activities people were
engaged in, as well as what was being referenced, when using the prototypes. To this end, I frame this exploration around
five questions: (1) what are the activities? (2) what are the references? (3) were the activities practical or cognitive? (4) did
the activity change over time? And finally (5) did the reference
change over time?
4.5.3.1

Activities

In regards to the activities people were involved in when using the prototypes, these can be divided into those related to
interaction and those of perception.

4.5 user study

interaction In regards to the interaction with H3 , I observed people holding the cube in their hand as they moved
throughout the observatory, but on occasions they would shake
the cube to request a reading from the telescope. Once the cube
began to represent the reading (through vibro-tactile feedback),
people generally stood still, stopped shaking the cube and help
it still to perceive the data representation. The generally interaction activities that I observed with the dowsing rod involved
people standing in one place and pointing the rod at different
headings. Once they decided upon a heading, they would press
the button on the rod and wait for a response (vibro-tactile feedback).
perception When observing people’s engagement with both
prototypes I noticed different ways of perceiving the representations. For instance, with H3 , some would hold it close to their
ear so that they could hear as well as feel the data, while others
would hold the cube in one hand and place the palm of their
other hand on one of the faces of the cube. In some cases, when
people were in groups they would encourage others to place
their hand on the cube as well, so that the act of perception was
shared between different members of the group. Whereas with
the dowsing rod, people generally maintained the heading of
the rod when perceiving the representation, although on some
occasions they would lower the rod or even bring it closer to
their ears to perceive both the sound and the haptic feedback.
When in the act of perception people generally were silent, although on some occasions I observed people communicating
their reaction, in real time, to others around them, for example:
“It feels really so tingly, I can even feel it going up my arms...”
4.5.3.2

Referential

When I think about what people are referencing as they work
with the prototypes, I divide this into two main categories. I
noticed people switching their attention between the source of
the data and the properties of the prototypes. Generally, when
people first picked up the prototypes they would refer to the
physical and visual properties of the prototypes, by commenting on their size, weight, texture, components, colour etc. For
instance, one person remarked when he first picked up H3 :

79

80

data, design and dasein

“It’s hard to believe that this little thing can see into space, there is
hardly anything to it just a few wires and a battery”
I also recorded numerous user comments about the texture
and shape of the dowsing rod, for example:
“It doesn’t feel like a computer, but I know it is kinda one, wouldn’t
it be nice if all computers felt so natural in your hands.”
People generally continued to reference the properties of the
prototypes until they activated the communication between the
prototypes and the telescopes, they would then begin to reference the source of the data. When perceiving the representation
emitted from both prototypes, I overheard people commenting
on the representation of phenomenon, for instance, one person
spoke about finding something large with the dowsing rod as
follows:
“I think I have found something big here, I must have pointed at a
star or planet or something, it feels way stronger than before, could it
be the moon? It must be big if it feels so strong.”
Another person spoke about perceiving weak vibrations emitted from H3 :
“There is nothing out there now, I can’t seem to feel anything, what
am I supposed to feel? Surely there has to be something out there but
I can’t seem to pick it up”
When I explore people’s experience of the prototypes through
the lens of Husserl’s theory of intentionality, I can see that the
structure of this experience is mediated by a number of different activities. I also see that these activities reference different
elements over time. I observed activities such as walking, standing still, shaking the prototype, pressing a button, pointing to
the sky, holding objects to their ear, talking, listening and many
more. I also noticed different points of reference, such as the
properties of the prototypes and the data source and these references seem to change over time depending of the context of
use.

4.5.4

Through Heidegger

In Chapter Two, I introduced Heidegger’s thoughts on equipment and temporality. In the following I explore people’s engagement with the prototypes through the lens of these concepts, first dealing with equipment and then temporality.
4.5.4.1

Equipment

One of Heidegger’s key ideas, in relation to how we encounter
the equipment of our lives, is the way he describes equipment
as being either ready-to-hand or present-at-hand. In the Observatory where the prototypes were deployed, visitors are surrounded by information about celestial phenomenon in the form
of textual descriptions, photographs and diagrams. The way
these objects are used by visitors can typically described as
present-at-hand as they facilitate only theoretical contemplation, in other words they are designed to be looked at and
not through. In saying this, there may be situations where visitor’s encounter with this equipment switches to ready-to-hand,
in particular when they become immersed in the content and
do not realise anymore that they are looking at a poster or reading text on a screen. However, these artefacts were not the focus of my observation during the study, instead I concentrated
with observing visitor’s encounters with the two prototypes.
These observations revealed the way visitors encountered the
prototypes (equipment) switched depending on the conditions
of use. For instance, once they had become familiar with the
prototypes—after using them for a prolonged period of time—
these encounters could be described as ready-at-hand, as the phenomena (data source) became the primary focus instead of the
equipment. On these occasions the users acted through the prototype, but the technology itself retreated from their immediate attention. Indications that pointed to this includes, the user
not looking at the prototype when in use, instead their attention and gaze was directed upwards toward the data source
(deep space). I also observed other types of encounters, such
as when users were coping with situations, for instance, during times when the prototype malfunctioned. On these occasions, the user became conscious of the prototype and it became the object of their attention, so switched from ready-tohand to present-at-hand or even unready-at-hand, as the user contemplated how to regain the functionality of the prototype.

81

82

data, design and dasein

4.5.4.2

Temporality

An interesting concept to use when examining people’s experience of and interaction with the prototypes is Heidegger’s
thoughts on temporality, especially considering the real-time nature of the data being represented. Heidegger postulated that
humans conceive the phases of temporality (past, present and
future) in either an authentic or inauthentic mode. In regards to
the future phase of temporality I noticed people acting in an authentic mode, in a manner that could be considered anticipating
what is to come rather that waiting in expectation. I conclude
this as, firstly as the phenomenon being represented is invisible
and far away from the user so their expectations were limited,
but also I observed numerous reactions to the representation
that could be described as surprised, for instance:
“wow, that was a like a jolt or an electric shock almost...”
I observed very few reactions that indicated the representation was something that the user expected.
In regards to the present phase, I again observed people acting in an authentic mode. Generally, I observed people reacting
to the representation in a positive sense, causing them to immediately respond either through bodily gestures or speech. I did
not observe anyone ignoring or, as Heidegger puts it, “turning
away” from the representation.
The final phase of temporality is the past; here Heidegger
states that we act in an authentic mode through repeatability,
or continually reflecting on or making use of what has happened already. The opposing (inauthentic) mode he describes
as when people consider the past to have elapsed entirely and
thus we forgot about what has happened. Again, I observed
the predominant mode in use was authentic. I observed people
continually reflecting on past representations to seemingly assist them to interpret the present representation. For instance,
when one participant felt the vibro-tactile feedback using the
dowsing rod he remarked:
“This is much weaker than the last one, there was definitely something back there but nothing here, I must of hit thin-air”

4.5 user study

4.5.5

Through Merleau-Ponty

In Chapter Two, I presented two of Merleau-Ponty’s ideas in relation to the role our body plays in the perception of the world
around us. With respect to people’s perception of data, I specially subscribe to his idea of the body schema and his notion
that we continue to attempt to gain a maximum grip on surrounding stimuli. In the following I apply these notions to my
observations of people’s use of H3 and the Solar Dowsing Rod.
4.5.5.1

Body Schema

As noted in Chapter Two, body schema is a form of bodily
awareness referring to how we understand our body in space.
As Merleau-Ponty puts it: our body is the medium by which
we experience the world, however, our body schema is flexible,
and when we become adept at using tools or equipment these
can be enveloped into our overall body schema.
When observing both prototypes in use, I noticed that as people became more adept at using them, their attention moved
from the prototype towards what was being represented (staring into space). When people were first handed the prototypes,
their attention was fixed on the physical object, but as time
passed, especially when using the dowsing rod, their attention
appeared to be on the data source (in the far distance). I observed people looking beyond the end of the rod toward the
point in Space they wanted to take a measurement from (as can
be seen in Fig. 4.1a). I also observed similar behaviour when
using H3 . When this prototype was first given to visitors in the
observatory, typically, they would begin to shake it to capture
a reading from the telescope and their gaze would be fixed
on the cube. However, as they became more adept and familiar with the prototype, they began to walk around the Observatory, shaking the cube at regular intervals but rarely looking at the cube. This was most evident when people stood in
front of other displays, such as photographs, text or diagrams
informing the visitors about hydrogen in deep space. During
these occasions I observed people reading or looking at the
textual information or photographic displays, while simultaneously shaking and perceiving the data representation (see Figure 15).

Observatory.

4.5.5.2

Maximum Grip

Merleau-Ponty’s concept of Maximum Grip pertains to people
continually striving toward an equilibrium with the world, or,
in more simplified terms, when we want to look at, feel, listen,
taste or even smell things around us we are solicited by objects that emit stimuli to place ourselves in the best position to
perceive the stimuli. My observations of people using the prototypes revealed many occasions when both prototypes solicited
people to gain a maximum grip on the representation. For instance, when people began to feel the vibration they would
grasp the objects in a different way. I noticed occasions when
people would use their fingers when pointing or shaking the
prototypes, although, when the prototypes emitted the vibrotactile feedback they would change their grip and place the
surface against the palm of their hand. I also noticed people
reacting to the auditory representation by bringing the cube
and dowsing rod closer to their ear, this was also evident when
the prototypes were being shared within a group, the person
in control would extend the prototype into the middle of the
group to allow all of the members to hear or feel the representation. Other members would sometimes respond by bending
down closer to the prototypes to better hear the sounds emitted
from the prototypes.

4.6 chapter summary

4.5.6

Through Ihde

Don Ihde’s theory on Human-technology relations involves four
different relationships we have with technology (Background,
Embodiment, Hermeneutic, or Alterity). From observing the prototypes in use, I conclude that two types of relations were evident:
Hermeneutical and Background. In Chapter Two, I presented Ihde’s
definition of Hermeneutical relations as: when we focused on the
technology, what one actually sees - immediately and simultaneously - is not the technology itself but rather the world
it refers to. This was evident when people perceive the representation emitted by the two prototypes. On these occasions I
noticed people referencing the source of the data instead of the
technology used to produce the representations:
“...it feels way stronger than before, could it be the moon? It must
be big if it feels so strong”
It should, however, be acknowledged that this type of relations only became apparent when people began to activate the
prototypes. Up to this point, when the prototypes were in their
hand, people generally seemed to consider them as an unconnected piece of technology without truly understanding their
purpose or functionality. However, once they began to perceive
the representation, the relationship between them and the technology quickly shifted and they did not refer to the technology
but beyond to what the technology was representing.
The other type of relationship that I observed was Background
Relations. I observed this occurring between the user and the
technology that is used to capture the data (the telescopes).
Background relations arise when we make use of something that
we do not directly experience; yet it gives structure to our experience. In this case, the user never comes in contact with or
directly experiences the telescope, however, these technologies
have a direct impact on their experience of the data. Essentially, without the telescopes the user would only experience
the dowsing rod and cube as static physical objects.
4.6

chapter summary

In this chapter, I started by describing the motivation, design
concept, and development of two bespoke data-driven artefacts

85

86

data, design and dasein

that embody live data through tangible interfaces. These prototypes allow visitors to a public Space Observatory to perceive
complex scientific data that would normally only be viewed
and analysed by experts. Over the course of one week I observed and interviewed visitors while they used the prototypes.
My general observations indicate that the tactile experience of
the information representation engaged visitors and felt less abstract, more real than graphic representations. Moreover, it triggered social interactions and conversation both about the perceived signal and its meaning. These preliminary findings indicate that representing complex data through non-traditional
modalities seems to be appealing for a casual user.
I also analysed the use of these prototypes through the prism
of the phenomenological concepts of Edmund Husserl, Martin
Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde. This analysis shows that interacting with and perceiving data represented
through tangible artefacts is a complex and multi-layered process. We see that the intentionality involved requires the users
to use multiple activities and the point of reference changes over
time (from the prototype to the data source and back). I also described the typical encounter visitors had with the prototypes
as being ready-to-hand, but on some occasions, such as when the
technology malfunctioned, this encounter switched to presentat-hand.
Applying Merleau-Ponty’s ideas on the role of the body, I
showed that once people became familiar with the prototypes
they became part of the users body schema and were experienced
as an extension of the medium (their body) they use to experience the world around them. I also showed how the prototypes solicited people to alter their position to best perceive the
various representational modalities used in the prototypes. Finally, I presented two different relationships that people have
with the technology in use. One of which involves the user
seeing through and beyond the technology to the data source
(Hermeneutical), and the other (Background) which occurs with a
technology that is hidden from the view of the user (telescope).
The aim of this chapter was to conduct a study that involved
the design and evaluation of tangible artefacts that represent
scientific data for a casual audience and to then capture people’s experience with these prototypes - through the lens of phe-

4.6 chapter summary

nomenological ideas. The remaining chapters of this thesis will
focus on Phenomenology from the perspective of a research approach and not its’ philosophical ideas.

5.1

introduction

In Chapter 2 and Chapter 3, I addressed the conceptual and
methodological foundations of my research by introducing aspects such as phenomenology, representational modality, and
evaluation techniques. I then drew these aspects together through
a design exercise in Chapter 4. To conclude the theoretical Part
of my thesis, I now present a systematic analysis of the literature and the state–of–the–art in data representations over the
last 150-years. In particular I focus on representations that require more than one sensory channel to fully interpret and understand the data.
The work I present in this chapter spans the entire duration
of my PhD. One of the first tasks I undertook shortly after
starting to work on my PhD was to create and start populating a database that included examples of data representations
that utilised modalities beyond vision. I categorised these examples as data sculptures (more recently physicalizations), sonifications, data represented through smell and taste and haptic
data representations. As the database began to grow I started
to notice that some of the representations were difficult to categorise. As these utilized more than one modality, they could
not be defined as a visualization, physicalization, sonification or
any other known category of representation, but could be described and categorised as Multisensory Data Representations.
This prompted me to carry out a review of the literature to
search for previous work on multisensory data representation.
Through this I discovered that while work on multisensory data
representation has been on-going across many disciplines since

89

90

a design space for multisensory data representations

the mid-1970’s, no one had surveyed the state-of-the-art of this
type of representation. With this knowledge in hand, in the
summer of 2012 I commenced a widespread survey with the
aim of establishing a design space for of Multisensory Data
Representations. While the database is still growing - as I continue to find new examples - almost four years after stating the
survey it is finally complete and in this chapter I present a design space for multisensory data representations1 .
Drawing on techniques and theories adapted from Thematic
Analysis and Prototype Theory, I analyse 154 examples of multisensory data representations to establish a design space along
three axes: use of modalities, representation intent and human-data
relations. I frame the discussion by presenting how a selection of
examples, chosen from the collection, fit into the design space.
This not only informs my own research but can also draw the
attention of the HCI, InfoVis and Design Research communities
to aspects of data representation that have hitherto been either
ill-defined or underexplored. I conclude by discussing key research challenges, which emerged from the exploration of the
design space and point out future research topics.
5.2

background

As discussed in Chapter 3 the study of data representations
beyond the visual modality, in particular the physical representation of data, has recently received increased attention (e.g [4]
[123] [275]). Reviews, such as [233] [196] [325] [279] also provide a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art in data
represented beyond the visual modality. Notwithstanding these
developments, I see limitations in the literature. First, research
has tended to focus on a single modality (cf. [215]) and few
studies have surveyed research across different disciplines, for
example InfoVis and HCI. Also, while research is continuing on
1 The work presented in this chapter is also described in a manuscript, in
review with the journal Interacting with Computers. This manuscript was
previously submitted to three other conferences (ACM TEI 2014, IEEE VIS
2014 and ACM TEI 2015. While the work received mixed responses from reviewers, I was repeatedly encouraged to continue with this line of enquiry.
In this chapter I present the final version of my design space exploration,
which is an extension of the submitted article. While this research was a collaboration with my PhD supervisor (Prof. Dr. Eva Hornecker), I was responsible for the vast majority of the work, which was overseen and reviewed by
my supervisor.

5.3 defining multisensory data representations

Figure 16: Year of publication/creation of the 154 examples from the
survey (x-axis: year, y-axis: amount) (see ?? for full list of
examples)

multisensory data representation (cf. [210] [244] [281] [259]) few
efforts have surveyed existing representations to identify key
research and design challenges. In this chapter I draw together
data representations from a wide range of disciplines (artistic,
design and scientific), which originated over a long time span
(1862–2015), and to analyse these along the same criteria (see
Figure 16).
I do this by first introducing the definition of Multisensory
Data Representations and follow by exploring the potential of
multisensory data representations and discussing their value,
for example how they offer a more holistic sensory experience
and allow the people to interpret the data in a manner that is
personal to them. The contribution of this chapter is as follows:
First, I define, for the first time, multisensory data representation.
Second, from 154 existing examples, I survey the state–of–the–
art in multisensory data representations. Third, I establish and
discuss a design space for multisensory data representations
and finally propose a research agenda based on research challenges and questions that are presently underexplored.

5.3

defining multisensory data representations

The aim of this chapter is not to reclassify current data representations or prescribe a new domain, I am more interested
in surveying an array of data representations across many disciplines to encourage a debate about the potential for using
more than one representation modality. Recent literature has

91

92

a design space for multisensory data representations

Whitelaw 2010 [315]. C: H3 by Hogan and Hornecker [105].

labelled data representations that do not rely exclusively on visualization as Sonification [143], Physicalization [125], Data Sculpture [325] Non-visual visualization [196] or Cross/Multimodal displays [108]. However, in the context of this research, these terms
pose difficulties. The sonification of data typically relies on a
single modality (auditory), while categorizing visualizations as
non-visual is also problematic, as the visual modality often remains an integral communicative aspect of the representation,
e.g. when physicalizations can be touched and seen. I therefore
prefer the term cross-modal or multi-modal display. Nevertheless, they are also problematic as the focus is on the output of
the representation and not on the sensory channel used to interpret the data. There are, however, terms that have already been
defined that more closely fit the type of data representation we
explore here, these are: Sensualization [210], Sensification [281]
or Perceptualization [34]. But as my aim is not to reclassify examples in my collection I discuss work situated across many
domains together under the umbrella term: Multisensory Data
Representations. I define this class of representation as follows:
“Multisensory data representations are a class of data representation that have a clear intent to reveal insight by encoding data in
more than one representational modality and require at least two sensory channels to fully interpret and understand the data.”
5.4

design space analysis

Design space analysis is a valuable approach to represent design rationale. Maclean and colleagues [168] identified it as a
tool to help designer’s reason about design, while also helping others to better understand why certain design decisions

5.4 design space analysis

have been made. With this in mind, my aim was to survey the
design space of data representations that seek to communicate
across more than one sensory channel. The main goal of exploring this space is to bridge the gap between theoretical concerns
and the practicalities of art and design, thereby providing an
overview of the possibilities, as well as identifying key research
challenges and questions when representing data beyond the
visual paradigm.
5.4.1

Methodology

In order to systematically understand the study and design of
multisensory data representations I surveyed existing examples,
which fit the definition outlined above, collected from fields
such as scientific research, design and art contexts. I identified
international conferences and periodicals that publish the most
articles related to this topic; these include ACM Conference on
Human Factors in Computing Systems, ACM Conference on
Tangible, Embedded and Embodied Interaction, IEEE Information Visualization Conference, ACM Transactions on ComputerHuman Interactions and IEEE Transactions on Visualization
and Computer Graphics. As well as journal articles and papers, I also examined posters, and demos, where applicable.
Furthermore I conducted a comprehensive online search for examples of work outside of academic publications, in particular
for artworks and surveyed work from online networks, such as
Creative Applications2 , research labs such as AVIZ3 , archives
of digital art exhibition, such as Ars Electronica4 and personal
websites of artists, designers and researchers.
When gathering examples for the survey I only included
work that fully met my definition of multisensory data representation. I excluded, for instance, work that relied predominantly on a single human sense to interpret the data or where
the data mapping is overly ambiguous with little or no intention to reveal any data insight. My collection by now contains
154 entries, and was used as the basis to establish the design
space. The full list of examples included in the collection can be

seen in ??5 . I acknowledge that there may be some examples
missing from the collection, mainly due to the lack of exposure surrounding the piece i.e. no publications or exhibitions.
However, I feel that the examples in the collection are a fair
representation of the state-of-the-art in multisensory data representation.
5.4.2

Analysis

The goal of this research was not to develop a taxonomy of
multisensory data representations, instead I was more interested in analysing a large collection of representations and to
establish a vocabulary when describing them. This can then be
used to shed light on the choices designers face when creating
multisensory data representations. Once I felt I had exhausted
the search for examples I commenced the process of analysis.
The overall goal of the analysis was to establish dimensions of
the design space and categorise each example in the collection
against these dimensions. The methodology I used is based on
Thematic Analysis [23]. This is a grounded approach, typically
used to analyse interview transcriptions to present an accurate
portrayal of how people feel, think, and behave within a particular context [81]. It is based on a set of procedures designed
to identify, examine, and report patterns (themes) that emerge
from the data. In the context of our study we followed five
discrete phases: (1) familiarization, (2) thematic coding, (3) abstraction, (4) structuring, and (5) categorisation (see Table 3).

familiarization The first phase of analysis involved repeatedly reading articles, interviews, descriptions and watching demonstration videos related to the examples in the collection. This was done to familiarize myself with examples in
the database even more. As with many qualitative study approaches, this is an essential phase of the data analysis, as it
allows the researcher to gain an overview of the data, which
later helps in the identification of thematic codes [81].
thematic coding During the process of familiarization I
annotated the examples with keywords and phrases that describe the key characteristics of each representation, which in5 I also make an online version of this database available at http://www.

cluded aspects such as functionality, use, context, data source
etc. Based on these annotations I derived an initial set of thematic codes from the data (see Table 3, column 3). Thematic
codes can be defined as parts of the data relevant to the research questions that capture the qualities of what is being investigated [23]. The process I followed was open coding, where
codes were only defined as they emerged from the data. After careful coding of all examples, preliminary codes were assigned and then validated, and minor adjustments applied before the list of codes was finalized. Only codes that featured
more than three times were utilized for further analysis.
abstraction and structuring Once I had completing
the coding, I commenced the process of sorting the codes into
themes. Themes are broader than thematic codes in that they
capture important details and meaningful patterns within the
data [24]. I produced an initial set of themes, which were then
reviewed and refined together with my supervisor (see Table 4,
column 2). These themes were then used to establish the dimensions of the design space, which are: use of modalities, repre-

sentation intent and human-data relations (see Table 4, column
1).
categorisation The final phase of analysis involved categorising the examples in the collection against the dimension of
the design space. The approach I took for this phase is adopted
from Prototype Theory [252]. Prototype theory is a mode of
graded categorization typically used in Cognitive Science, where
some members of a category are more central than others. In
the context of my research, I applied aspects of this theory
when sorting examples from the collection into the three dimensions of the design space. I specifically adhered to the two
notions, which, over time, have been assimilated into prototype theory. First, Family Resemblance, made popular by Ludwig Wittgenstein, where members of a category (in my case:

5.5 design space

dimension) may be related to one another without having any
properties in common that define the category [253]. Second,
I subscribed to the notion of Generality, where some members
of a category (dimension) may be “better examples” of that
category than others [149]. To explain this process further, for
my design space dimension of representation intent, the decision on which end of the dimension each example should
be placed was based on the available literature, including testimonies from the creators as well as independent reviews of the
work. In some cases, there was very little information available,
so I had to make a judgement based on personal experience
of the domain. Once this process was completed, a database
was produced that lists the title, credit, year, number and type of
modality, data type, and mode of interaction of each example in the
collection.
5.5

design space

I established the design space along three axes of dimensionality: use of modalities, representation intent and human-data relations.
The dimensions of the design space can be though of as design
choices or questions that system designers must address when
creating a multisensory data representation. In the following,
I discuss these dimensions of the design space individually; I
then use this space as a basis for discussing important design
and research challenges and proposing a set of recommendations and guidelines for the future study and design of multisensory data representations.
5.5.1

Use of Modalities

The first dimension of the design space is Use of Modalities. It is
based on the themes: multimodal representation, cross-modal
representation, sensory modality, representation modality, different materials in use, data insight through experience (see
Table 4, column 2, row 1). Hoggan and Brewster [107] have already made a distinction between cross-modal and multimodal
interaction. In cross-modal interaction, different information is
transmitted via different modalities, while multimodal interaction refers to the same information being transmitted by each
modality. I apply the same concept to data representation. For
instance, Ryoji Ikeda’s installation Data.anatomy[civic] encodes
different data, derived from the latest Honda Civic car, in audi-

97

98

a design space for multisensory data representations

tory and visual outputs, thus I consider this to be an example
of cross-modal representation [118]. However, Tac-tile [302], encodes the same data in sounds and vibration to allow visually
impaired users to browse graphical information, this I consider
to be a multimodal representation.
In regards to sensory modality and representation modality
I also apply a distinction between these two types of representations. I use the term representation modality, when referring
to the representational artefact, as this relates to the representational format, medium or material that the data is encoded
in. However, when referring to modality from the perspective
of the user/audience, I use the term sensory modality; this
refers to the human sensory channel used to perceive and interpret the data. The rationale for this differentiation arose during
the survey when I found multimodal data representations that
may not be considered as multisensory, as they only require
one sensory channel to interpret the data. An example of this
can be seen in Nathalie Miebach’s series of intricate data sculptures: Changing Waters (see Figure 22). Although this piece,
which is a physical representation of weather and oceanic data,
incorporates numerous modalities and materials, the viewers
rely mainly on their sense of vision to interpret the representation. I do however acknowledge that its three-dimensional
form may affect the perception of the representation, as people can imagine what it would be like to touch. Piaget and Inhelder [131] were first to explain that spatial concepts, such as
form, distance, space etc. are perceived and understood as internalized actions and not as mental images of external things.
Search [259] also notes that bodily movement is an integral part
of the perceptual experience, which helps to interrogate and
understand virtual and physical objects in space. Thus I consider Changing Waters, and others like it, to be multisensory.
Although the viewer is not allowed to touch the piece, when
they physically navigate around the representation their perception of the data may be altered during this process when vision interrelates with kinaesthetic experience. This may not be
defined as touch, in the traditional sense, however, kinesthetic
body movement, combined with the variety of materials in use
may result in a wider sensory experience, a phenomenon that
does not appear in traditional two-dimensional representations
such as bar graphs.

5.5 design space

in combination with other modalities. B: Pie chart (left):
Combinations of sensory modalities.

The use of alternative representation modalities and materials can be mapped to a similar shift in approach to computing
in general. Over the last two decades, HCI subfields such as
ubiquitous computing [309], tangible interaction and computational materiality [121] have sought to free computing from the
traditional computer and display monitor. Data representations
have gone through a similar shift, albeit from analogue to digital representations. Starting in the late 20th century, assisted
by the proliferation of personal computing and the democratization of data, a systematic research effort was coordinated,
under the umbrella of InfoVis, to explore the use of digital pixels as units of data representation.
In the following, I first discuss the use of sensory modality
in multisensory data representations, following this I focus on
modality through the lens of materiality. I conclude my discussion of this dimension by highlighting a recently emerging trend, which does not encode the data in modalities but
through the experience of using data-driven artefacts.

5.5.1.1

Sensory Modalities

The analysis of the 154 examples shows that the predominant
sensory modalities required (as part of a set) to interpret the
data is sight (151) and touch (144) (see Figure 18, B). While 22
also required the audience to interpret the representation by
listening to the representation, only five examples were found
that incorporated other sensory modalities (taste and smell). Regarding the combination of senses to interpret the data, 139 required touch and sight and 11 required more than two sensory
channels (see Figure 18, A). One example of a representation

99

100

a design space for multisensory data representations

Figure 19: Tac-tile system. Graphics tablet augmented with a tangible
pie chart relief, with dynamic tactile display [302]

that requires more than one sensory channel to fully interpret
the data is Tac-tile (see Figure 19). Tac-tile allows visually impaired users to browse graphical information using tactile and
audio feedback. While the user browses pie charts with a stylus pen, the data is transmitted to the user’s non-dominant
hand through vibrotactile feedback as well as the pitch of a
sound emitted through speakers. Using more than one modality to represent data is not only a remit of assistive technology;
we also found examples in other domains. Visual artist Ryoji
Ikeda’s installation Data.anatomy[civic] [118] immerses an audience in an audio-visual experience driven by “the entire data
set of the latest Honda Civic car”. This multisensory experience
offers the audience a unique insight into the complexity of modern car design and manufacturing processes by mapping data
points to sounds and dynamic graphics.
Another example from the arts is Perpetual (Tropical) SUNSHINE [1], this installation emits heat and light through a ’screen’
composed of several hundred infra-red light bulbs. The data
driving this installation is transmitted by weather stations situated all around the Tropic of Capricorn, which measure the
real-time intensity of the sun. Typically, ambient temperature,

5.5 design space

Figure 20: Perpetual (Tropical) SUNSHINE by fabric | ch [1]

which is controlled in part by the sun, is translated into numerical data and represented in the format of Fahrenheit or
Celsius, however, this installation directly translates the heat
and amount of light emitted from the sun to the heat and light
from infra-red bulbs (see Figure 20). An example that relies on
taste, smell and sight is the recent work of the design researcher
Moritz Stefaner [271]. An experimental research project, Data
Cuisine explores food as a means of data representation or as
Stefaner refers to it as – “edible diagrams”.
materiality To fully appreciate the role representational
modality plays in multisensory data representation I must also
address materiality. The materials used in the representation
of data not only dictates (in most cases) the sensory channel
used to perceive the data, but they may also have a metaphorical role. Gross and colleagues [80] recently asserted “materiality of computation is best observed indirectly through the artefacts that employ it and interactions with those artefacts” [80,
p.639], whereas Vallgårda and Redström [290] claim that computation needs to be combined with other materials before we
can consider it to be a material itself. However, Dourish and
Mazmanian [53] argue that digital information (data) should
be considered a material, in that it is only ever encountered

101

102

a design space for multisensory data representations

Figure 21: A. From Over Here by Paul May [176]. B. Form Follows Data
by Iohanna Nicenboim [204]

in material form, and its properties are revealed in the process
of interacting with these forms. In attempting to apply these
concepts to the materiality of data representation, it is easy to
reconcile this with Gross and colleagues assertion that computation (or data) is best viewed through representational artefacts,
however, the other concepts of informational materiality seem
to conflict, as Dourish and Mazmanian [53] disagree with Vallgårda and Redström [290]. Thus, I lean towards Vallgårda and
Redström’s view, as data is inherently imperceptible and can
only be experienced through the lens, form, sound or taste of
what is representing it, for example, data is viewed through the
digital or analogue marks of a visualization, while data is experienced by viewing and touching the three-dimensional form
of a physicalization.
I here focus on the materiality of the objects and surfaces
which the data has been encoded in. Table 5 shows the range
of materials used to represent data in the 154 examples I surveyed, sorted by the sensory channel used for interpreting the
representation. It should be noted, however, that some materials may be interpreted using several sensory channels, such
as wood (sight and touch). When investigating materiality, I
framed the analysis around the following question: is the motivation for material choice metaphorically linked to the data source?
From the examples I surveyed I only found a few that use materials I consider to be metaphorically linked to the data source.
One example is Paul May’s ’From Over Here’ (see Figure 21,
A), which comprises of numerous laser-cut paper cards, each
representing a month of articles from the New York Times

(1992-2010) that relate to Ireland. The length of each card is
mapped to the numbers of articles from that month. To explore
this representation, people are encouraged to handle and rearrange the cards. The tactile quality of the material (paper)
facilitates this as well as referencing the source of the data.
The choice of materials used in Iohanna Nicenboim’s (see Figure 21,B) series Form Follows Data is also metaphorically linked
to the data source. This incorporates a collection of domestic objects, whose traditional form has been altered and controlled by
personal data. The inner form of a ceramic coffee cup has been
produced to represent the amount of coffee that a person consumes every morning over the course of a week. In Hal Watts
piece Can We Keep Up? the choice of materials is also closely
linked to the data source. Constructed out of compressed cellulose sponge, it is laser cut to the shape of a country, where the
thickness of the sponge represents domestic water usage data
from that country [308].
The majority of examples I surveyed showed no evidence
that the material choice has any metaphorical connection to
the data source. To exemplify this, I return again to Nathalie
Miebach’s woven sculpture Changing Weather (see Figure 22).
Although the perception of movement in this piece may resemble the sometimes-chaotic nature of the represented weather
conditions, the material, which consists of wicker, yarn, thread
and plastic, is not related symbolically or metaphorically to the
data source. Although there maybe no direct link between the
choice of materials and the data source, the materials and tech-

niques used to assemble this piece certainly add interest and
intrigue. This strategy is often employed by data artists who
seek to offer more than just data insight, by creating aesthetic,
provocative, and engaging work that sometimes facilitates the
generation of meaning that goes beyond the topic of the data
source.

5.5.1.2

Beyond Representation Modality

During the survey I also found nine recent examples that utilize properties beyond representation modality to communicate
information about the data source. Although the data in these
may be encoding in the physical or digital properties of the
artefact, the generation of data insight is primarily facilitated
through the experience of using the data representation. An example of this is Melanie Bossert’s “The World’s Best Spintop” (see
Figure 23, A). This piece consists of a number of 3D printed
spintops, where the shape of each spintop is a translation of
political, environmental, health, education, and economic data
from a specific country. Once the data for the country is collated, an algorithm generates the shape of a spin top, if a coun-

5.5 design space

try performs ’poorly’ the generated shape will be irregular and
the handle will be small, which results in the spintop being
difficult to set and maintain motion. However, if the data indicates that the country has performed ’well’ the shape will be
more symmetrical and the handle will be long enough to grasp
(making it easy to set in motion). Although the data is encoded
in the physical properties of the spintop (much like the other
physicalizations mentioned already) the data can not be fully interpreted until the spintop is in motion, which means the data
has been encoded in the shape as well as the performance of
the representation. Another example that encodes data beyond
the traditional modalities is Life Don’t Mean A Thing If It Ain’t
Got That Swing(see Figure 23, B), a usable swing installation
that encodes data related to the satisfaction levels of a countries population in the architectural properties of the swing i.e.
the length of rope, the height of the seat etc. People interpret
the data through the enjoyment of their ride on the swing, so if
the data indicates that the people of a country are unsatisfied
the length of the swing will be short and the seat will be narrow,
making the experience of swinging less appealing or exciting.
Another example is the collaborative artwork Change Ringing by artist Peter Shenai and composer Laurence Osborn (see
Figure 23, C). In this climate data, representing changes in temperature over the last century, is encoded in the shape of six
cast bronze bells. Again, the data translated into the physical
properties of the objects, however, the audience cannot fully interpret or perceive the data until they hear the different sounds
that emanate when each bell has been rang. All these examples
illustrate a new departure for the use representation modality,
away from representational modalities such as visual, physical,
sound, smell and taste to new ways of encoding data in the performance, affordance and experience of the data representation.

5.5.2

Representational Intent

During the analysis of examples in the collection I extracted five
themes related to the system designer’s intention when creating multisensory data representations. These are: casual representations, utilitarian representations, work of art, reveal little data
insight, and reveal large data insight (see Table 4, column 2, row
2). These describe the motivation for creating the representa-

tion and the purpose of using it. The intent and motivation of
those who create multisensory data representations is no different to those in many other areas of art and design. Some
work is designed to serve utilitarian needs and convey information in a clear manner, while others take a more open-ended
approach, by seeking to evoke an emotional response or triggering conversations or debate about a concern related to, or
inspired by their work. Traditionally, the primary purpose of
data representation has been to provide people with an analytical tool that enhances human cognition about a task, and
the primary value has typically been assessed along the lines
of effective and efficient discovery of information [316]. More
recently, however, some have attempted to broaden the meaning formed from interpreting representations to include more
open-ended insight, such as creating awareness and evaluating
the emotional response to the representation (cf. [197].
Through my exploration of the design space I categorize representational intent along the dimension of utilitarian to casual,
as I feel these terms capture the essence of all themes that make
up this dimension. Data representations whose intent I define
as being utilitarian target a specific audience to reveal data insight related to a explicit task, such as using coloured building
blocks to represent production problems within a large orga-

5.5 design space

nization [216]. Whereas the intended audience of casual representations is much broader, and the exploration of data may be
more open-ended and not related to a work task, such as a piece
of data art located in a gallery space (see for example Changing
Weather by Nathalie Miebach Figure 22). In my survey, the majority of examples (115/154) were created for a casual audience.
I base this classification (utilitarian or casual) on a number of
factors, including the description provided by the creators of
the representation, the domain the work was created in (i.e.,
scientific or artistic), as well as my own interpretation/experience.
5.5.2.1

Utilitarian

Returning again to the work of Wall and Brewster, Tac-tile provides a good example of a multisensory data representation developed primarily to serve the functional needs of its users [302].
In explaining their motivation for Tac-tile, Wall and Brewster
point toward the “lack of access to data visualizations” for people with visual impairment [304, p.10], which hinders them
from engaging in “numerate disciplines such as maths, economics or the sciences” [304, p.17]. In creating Tac-tile, they
offer people, who have a visual impairment, a representation
that allows them to explore and interpret data using both auditory and haptic perception. Another example from the survey
that serves the utilitarian needs of a broader section of society is
Water Usage, a prototype design by Nadeem Haidary [85]. This
piece contains a visible compartment within a faucet, which
acts as a visualization of the amount of water consumed each
time the faucet is used. A description of the work by the designer states: “As water flows out, a small portion of the water
gets redirected through a valve into the faucet’s glass chamber,
showing the person how much water they are currently using.”
Although there is clear effort by Haidary to create a smart, playful and striking design, the primary purpose of this product is
to make the user aware of water consumption. Another example that assists in an explicit task is the Rearrangeable 3D Bar
Chart created by Yvonne Janson and colleagues [123], which
was created to compare the efficiency of physical and virtual
data representations. This representation can be viewed and
held when interpreting the data and is created to replicate all
the features of a virtual bar graph.

5.5.2.2

Casual Use

At the other end of this dimension are representations that are
created for a more casual user/audience and typically represent non-critical data. This type of representation may be seen
as a medium for artistic expression that draws attention to an issue/concern or an informal information display situated in our
work or home life. Over the past decade an increasing number
of artists have used data as part of their work to make statements and encourage public debate on various cultural, political or social issues. Viégas and Wattenberg discuss, in detail,
some of this work [300].
I believe that expanding the perceptual field of representation beyond the visual modality offers practitioners more scope
to create representations that evoke personal meaning in their
audience. Although no research has focused on the affect multisensory representations have on people, in subsequent chapters I will show that the meaning acquired by people when interpreting representations that use non-traditional representational modalities such as haptic and auditory is different from
what is generated through the visual modality. A multisen-

5.5 design space

sory data representation that exemplifies this is Pulse [140],
created by Berlin based artist Markus Kison (Figure 24). A livevisualization, Pulse uses social data - from private weblog communities such as www.blogger.com. The piece is framed around
the concepts developed by Robert Plutchik’s in his book Psychoevolutionary Theory of Emotion. Pulse translates emotion-based
tags found in recent blog entries via an algorithm into a series
of instructions that manifest in sounds and temporal sculptural
forms generated by a shape-shifting object. The artist is intentionally vague about the process of mapping the data, leaving
it completely open to interpretation of the audience. In comparison to this, the mapping used in lgail Reynolds piece “Mount
Fear” is very clear (see Figure 25, A) and although the data
source represented in this piece (violent crimes in East London
between 2002-2003) would normally be associated with more
utilitarian data representations (i.e. see Figure 25, B), I consider
this piece (and others like it) to be casual as it is displayed
within an art gallery and its purpose is to draw attention to an
issue/concern and to trigger debate.
The type of data insight revealed to the viewer through both
of these examples varies, but it is clear that the data insight revealed is not intended to assist in any work related task. However, this is rarely the intention of the artists, it is more about
provoking the audience to interpret the work in a way that is
meaningful to them. A key characteristic of representations that
lie at this end of the representational intent dimension is the
open-ended and personal nature of the data insight revealed. It
is rare for the artist/designer to intend the same meaning or insight to emerge for everyone who engages with the piece, while
at the opposing (Utilitarian) end of the dimension, the intention
is to reveal similar data insight for everyone who engages with
the data representation.

5.5.3

Human-Data Relations

The final dimension of the design space addresses the interaction between people and multisensory data representations
as well as the nature of the data in use. This dimension was
derived from combining the themes: interactive systems, noninteractive systems, using live data, and using archived data (see

109

110

a design space for multisensory data representations

Figure 25: A: Mount Fear with permission from Abigail
Reynolds [240], B: The distribution of London crime
rates (source http://maps.met.police.uk/)

Table 4, column 2, row 3).
The digital age has allowed us to move beyond the printed
page to bits, pixels and atoms, and has opened new possibilities
for designers to offer engagement with data in ways not possible before. Digital technology also meant that live data streams
can now be represented through various dynamic interfaces.
Exploring the phenomenon of interaction is a fundamental aspect of HCI research, however, apart from some notably examples (cf. [27] [33]) it has received far less attention within the
InfoVis community. This may partially be due to the different
relationship that users have with digital artefacts in the context of InfoVis as opposed to HCI. This was first illustrated by
Ware [306], who identified the concept of asymmetry in data
rates, where more data flows from a visualization to the user
than from the user to the system. Thus, the interaction is more
about altering or exploring the representation than about inputting data.
My design space analysis explores the mode of interaction in
terms of active verses passive engagement, these axes represent
the themes: interactive systems and non-interactive systems (see
Table 4. Column 2, row 3). I follow this by addressing the type
and nature of the represented data source (dynamic and static),
which corresponds with the themes: using live data and using
archived data. I categorise these themes under the same dimension as they often relate. A data representation that requires
interaction to fully interpret the data I define as active, whereas
I consider representations that do not require or encourage interaction as being passive. While I acknowledge that all data

5.5 design space

Figure 26: Design space dimension: human-data relations, showing
the combination of interaction mode and nature of data.

representations (multisensory or not) require some level of engagement to gain meaning, I only consider these to be active
if they require people to intentionally manipulate the representation or data. I consider data to be dynamic if it is live
or multidimensional, whereas data that is fixed and archived I
consider static. When analysing the examples in the collection,
each could be categorised under one of four possible options:
passive/static, passive/dynamic, active/static and active/dynamic.
Following the analysis of examples, I found passive interaction
and static data to be the most frequent combination (91), while
passive interaction combined with dynamic data is the least common combination (4). The distribution of data types is more
even when combined active interaction: active/static: 25 and active/dynamic: 35 (see Figure 26).

5.5.3.1

Interaction Mode

passive My survey shows that the dominant mode of interaction with multisensory data representations is passive (93)
(see Figure 27, B). Datafountain [188] exemplifies this, as it does
not facilitate or offer any means of interaction beyond looking
and listening to the representational output. This work uses
water fountains as an information display (see Figure 28), it in-

corporates jets of water whose height is controlled by live data.
In one application of this concept the creators mapped the latest value of three international currencies to corresponding water jets. The creators consider Datafountain to be an example
of calm technology or an ambient information display that remains at the periphery of our attention. As the audience has
no control over the representation, I consider this to be passive
engagement, however, the nature of the data is dynamic as it is
collected from a live data stream. An example that I also consider to be passive is Fundament by Andreas Nicolas Fischer
(see Figure 17, A), although this piece affords and encourages
physical contact with the material that the data is encoded to
(wood), we cannot manipulate the data source or representation in any way, this process is purely about perception and
interpretation.

active Many examples (61) in my survey facilitate and encourage active engagement between the user and the data representation. An example that exemplifies this is Wable, which
comprises of a motorized physical bar chart that represents the
online activity of a person logged into the system [148]. Each of
the physical bars can be configured to link to online social network accounts, such as www.twitter.com or www.facebook.com.
The system monitors these accounts, and if activity increases
(e.g. re-tweets, or shared posts) the bar rises (or visa-versa). A
slider button incorporated into the physical interface also allows viewing of past activity. Wable facilitates active engagement while also being dynamic by linking to live data streams,
however, the user does not enter any data into the system. Although I acknowledge that the interaction with Wable is quite

limited, the system does allow the user to choose which data
stream is being represented which may facilitates a sense of
ownership for users of the system. An example that facilitates
much more interaction between the data and the user is Virtual Gravity (see Figure 29). Using Google Insights6 as the data
source, this system represents past search queries of the user.
Using a tangible placed on a smart surface the user ’grabs’ two
words and places them on a digitally mediated physical weighing scale. The frequency of the searches is represented through
weight, which means that the more searches the heavier the
word will become and thus moving their side downwards. The
complex interaction of Virtual Gravity facilitates a rich and informative engagement between the user and the data source
and allows for indebt exploration of the data [99].

Nature of Data

When I analysed the thematic codes applied to the examples
in the collection I identified a number that related to the na6 https://www.google.com/insights/

ture of the data, these include: dynamic, database, archived, live
and static. These were then used to establish the themes: using archived data (static), using live data (dynamic), which I now
use as the basis of my discussion on this aspect of the dimension. I could consider these data properties as polar dimensions
(see Figure 27, A); however, some data could be considered
as possessing the characteristics from both poles. For instance
data.anatomy[civic] [118] represents a data set which, due to
its size and multidimensionality, may be perceived as being dynamic, whereas, in fact, the data that drives this installation
is retrieved from a static archived data set. An example of a
multisensory data representation that uses static data is From
Over Here (see Figure 21, A). Although the data represented
in this piece is relatively large and spans a long period of time
(8 years), it is neither live nor multidimensional. Each datum
is a single integer, which, when added represents the number
of New York Times articles that refer to Ireland over a given
period of time.
Representing dynamic data, in particular live data, can be
challenging, especially from a technical perspective, as the representational artefacts require a constant connection to the data
source, which in turn continually updates the representation.
One example from the collection that generates a multisensory
representation of data, which is both live and multidimensional

5.5 design space

is The Rhythm of the City [82]. This art piece translates geotagged content from social media platform, such as www.twitter.
com, www.flickr.com and www.youtube.com, into the rhythm of
a physical metronome in real time (see Figure 30). Each of the
10 metronomes in the installation is linked to a different city
around the world, the more online conversations, stories and
media (relating to the city) that are uploaded to the web, the
faster the rhythm of the metronome becomes, thus representing the city’s pace of life.

5.5.4

Plotting the Design Space

Over the previous sections I introduced and discussed the design space for multisensory data representation. I now select
twenty representations from the collection and trace their position in each dimension to present a snapshot of how the design space is populated. When selecting the twenty examples
I wanted to show a fair representation of the breadth of the
design space and examples included in the collection. For instance, the majority of examples in the collection are situated at
the casual end of the dimension: Representational Intent, this
is reflected in the twenty examples chosen, and was similarly
done for the other dimensions. The examples used include:
Live Wire (Dangling String) [126], Illuminating Clay [228], Tactons [25], Mount Fear [240], Tides and Poles (series) [192], Weather
Bracelet [314], Paper Note [268], Data Cuisine [271], From Over
Here [176], Underwater [22], Google Eye [20], Smell Maps [185],
Touching Air [231], Sensetable [217], Centograph [285], Pulse [140],
Taste Maps [186], Data Fountain [188], Season in Review [282], Virtual Gravity [99], and Edible Bits [177].
Figure 31 shows the three dimensions of the design space,
and each of the twenty examples are placed into a group along
each. Thin coloured lines trace the trajectory of the representations through each dimension, similar to a parallel coordinates
plot. However, unlike a typical parallel coordinates plot, the
axis labels are different in each column (dimension). When inspecting the graph two zig-zag patterns emerge, these patterns
represent a correlation between different dimensions of the design space. First, we can see a collection of representations that
use two modalities, are also (with two exceptions) casual in intent. These also utilize static data and are generally passive (see

115

116

Figure 31: green shading). Whereas those that use three modalities tend to be utilitarian in intent, with dynamic data and
offer user interaction. These patterns are also evident when we
increase the number of examples in the parallel coordinate plot.
I previously highlighted the pertinacity of representations,
which offer interaction, to be coupled with dynamic data, whereas
passive representations are more likely to use static data. This
trend also appears when I populate the design space with examples. However, Figure 31 shows us further correlations between separate dimensions of the design space. These zig-zag
patterns raise a number of fundamental questions, including:
Why do casual representations, more often than not utilise only two
modalities, while utilitarian representations use more? Although I
do not have any clear evidence that explains this trend, I can
surmise that increasing the use of modalities provides people
with more options to generate insight from the data, while the
generation of rich data insight may not be the priority of the
creators of casual representations. I can also question: why do
casual representations tend to offer passive engagement with static
data, but utilitarian representations tend to be interrogated through
active interaction with dynamic data? The reason for this trend
may also be related to the type of data insight that is offered by
the representations, or maybe, the level of data insight generated is a reflection of the type of data and mode of interaction.

discussion

When I analysed the design space it provoked three key research questions and challenges that have as yet to be fully addressed. These are: (1) Does adding modalities add value? (2) How

lines trace each representation’s position along the design
space.

do multisensory data representations affect and change the user experience? and (3) When is a representation not a representation? In the
following I discuss each of these individually. Derived from this
discussion, I address the research areas that are presently underexplored and list five key recommendations for addressing
these issues.
5.6.1

Does Adding Modalities Add Value?

Once I had analysed the design space regarding the use of
modalities, I questioned: Does adding more representational modalities add further value to the representation? It may be argued that
additional modalities increase the richness of a representation
by stimulating more sensory channels. However, adding modalities may also increase the cognitive demand on people to reveal data insight. Research in cognitive psychology suggests
that extraneous cognitive load is caused by unnecessary cognitive processes [128]. For instance, if a representation uses two or
more modalities to represent the same data (cross-modal) without revealing anything new, this not only creates redundancy,
but can also increase the cognitive load required to interpret
the representation [69].
Notwithstanding these concerns, research in instructional design has demonstrated that increasing the range of modalities
used in a presentation can increase its’ effectiveness in terms
of enhanced learning with less mental effort [280]. Although
work has commenced (particularly in the field of visual analytics) to investigate the cognitive and perceptual capabilities
needed to explore complex data representations (cf. [128]), this
research has tended to focus exclusively on mono-modal, visual
representations. Thus, more research is required to investigate
under what conditions the addition of modalities increases the
performance and enhances the user-experience of data representation. From an artistic perspective, expanding the sensory
perception of a data representation, which may result in possible overloading of audience’s cognitive processes, could be a
deliberate strategy by the artist.
When discussing the representational intent dimension, I categorised representations as being either casual or utilitarian. I
believe that multisensory data representations at either end of
this dimension benefit from expanding the use of representa-

5.6 discussion

tional modalities. For instance, representations created to assist
people with an explicit task, such as Tac-tile [302] offer the option to perceive data using two discrete sensory channels. Not
only does Tac-tile demonstrate the functional value of combining modalities, it was also found that it can potentially “support
collaboration and communication between visually impaired
people and sighted colleagues working with a shared representation” [304, p.1132]. At the other end of this dimension, where
the purpose of a representation is not task related, but reveals
or draw attention to an issue or concern, I argue that the generation of data insight is merely a part of the overall experience
that the creator is hoping to achieve and in some cases the generation of insight is not the end of the cognitive process but is
meant to act as a trigger for further contemplation about the
data source. Whether the intention of the creator is to support
a task or draw attention to a concern, data representations that
stimulate more than one sensory channel, I argue, facilitates a
more holistic sensory experience and allows the user/audience
to interpret the data in a manner that is personal to them.
5.6.2

Do Multisensory Data Representations Affect and Change the
User Experience?

In my design space analysis I distinguished representations
that allow user engagement from those that do not (active verses
passive). I also surveyed representations along the trajectory of
representational intent from utilitarian to casual. This analysis
showed that not alone do multisensory data representations allow for the full spectrum of human interaction, but also, the
type of insight people generate from these varies from analytical discovery over awareness to intrigue or even curiosity. I
believe that the main challenge that this holds for the research
and design community is the approaches we take and the methods we employ when evaluating multisensory data visualizations. Chen and Czerwinski [39] have already stressed the need
for improved methods in areas such as task analysis, usability
evaluation and usage analysis. However, apart from rare examples (cf. [321], the vast majority of empirical studies evaluate
the usability of data representations based on traditional measures such as efficiency and effectiveness. The InfoVis research
community have recently began to acknowledge the shortfall in
approaches and techniques to measure non-analytical aspects
of information visualizations. Lam and colleagues [150] point

119

120

a design space for multisensory data representations

to a lack of work that studies people’s subjective experiences
of information visualization and Vande Moere and Claes [197]
have recently advocated incorporating qualitative and tacit aspects in future research on physicalization. Jackson and colleagues [122] encourage the use of design processes such as
sketching, ideation and critique, that are widely used in related
design fields as a form of early evaluation, while North [207]
discuss the benefits of complementing low-level studies with
insight-based evaluation strategies. Beyond the evaluation of
use, there have also been attempts to assess the perceptual qualities of data representations. Most notably, Lang [151] discussed
the role of aesthetics in data representation as being more than
just a vehicle to engage the user but an integral part of the “science” of representation. Although I recognize that there is an inherent difficulty in measuring non-analytical insight facilitated
by data representations such as awareness, intrigue and curiosity, the field of HCI has recently witnessed a renewed interest
in evaluating such properties (cf. [320]). Employing methods already used in HCI, to measure the value of data representations
will help researchers to better understand the way people make
sense from multisensory data representation. There is some evidence that shows representational modality does affect the way
people experience data, however, to date, there is little research
that examines the affect that multisensory data representations
have on people’s ability to generate insight.
5.6.3

When is a Representation Not a Representation?

The final question concerns the purpose of creating multisensory data representations. Although this question could be asked
of any data representation (multisensory or not), it was provoked by my exploration of the design space and in particular
the dimension of representational intent. In my analysis of this
dimension I have shown that there is a wide range of scientific,
design or artistic intent in their creation. While the purpose of
representations that reveal explicit information is clear, those
that facilitate the generation of more open-ended or personally
meaningful insight can be equally valuable for the intended audience. This is illustrated by Kosara who argues that the goal
of data representations with this intent are unlike other forms
of representation, in that they are used to “communicate a concern” rather than facilitate explicit data insight [142]. With this
in mind, I believe that designers and researchers need to be

5.6 discussion

mindful when employing novel mapping techniques, where
the primary aim is provoke open interpretation and personal
reflection in the audience. In this case, the data may become
merely a medium and is not integral to the information that is
being transferred to the audience. I do recognize, however, the
boundary between a data representation and a piece of art is
sometimes hazy, and it is not always the intention of the creator
to define which side of the line the representation is positioned.
Quite often it is left to the audience to appreciate the work as
an artistic creation or as a carrier of information, and the value
of the work may lie in blurring or shifting this line.

5.6.4

Underexplored Areas and Future Challenges

I conclude this exploration by highlighting research challenges
that are hitherto underexplored and warrant investigation for
this field of research to evolve and expand. My survey showed
that the predominant combination of senses required when
interpreting the representations is touch and vision (130). Although data sonification is a vibrant field, my survey showed
that combining the perceptual qualities of sound with those of
vision or touch is still somewhat rare (11). Also, apart from a
few recent examples (e.g. [271]) data is very rarely interpreted
using the other senses: taste and smell. I also note that using humans’ innate ability to detect other stimuli, beyond those governed by the traditional senses is underexplored. Apart from
Perpetual (Tropical) SUNSHINE (Figure 20), which relies on
our ability to sense temperature, we found no examples that
rely on our sense of, for example, balance, pain or our kinesthetic sense, to form meaning from a representation.
I also note that the majority of examples in the survey (72%)
were aimed at single users. Apart from some notable exceptions
(cf. [217]), both traditional and multisensory data representations have typically been created with the purpose of communicating to a single person. Moving representations beyond a
single modality may provide an opportunity to expand the size
of the audience, while also supporting collaboration. In similar
terms, the size of the data set typically used in representations
to date is small. During my review I found very few (3) that
represented large data sets. What is commonly known today as
Big Data has received minimal attention in regards to extending

121

122

a design space for multisensory data representations

the modalities that represent these extremely large data sets.
The final aspect of multisensory data representations that I
see as being relatively underexplored is the concept of submodalities, in particular the properties of the different representational modalities that can be exploited to create a successful data representation. The field of cartography has a rich tradition of investigating these properties, which dates back to
Jacques Bertin’s seminal work on visual variables published in
1967 [13]. First identified for use in sign-systems, Bertin identified seven visual variables (position, size, value, texture, colour,
orientation and shape) and presented a set of rules for their appropriate use, based on whether the visualized data are nominal,
ordinal or quantitative. While research has continued over the
years to validate Bertin’s visual variables (cf. [41], MacEachren’s
work [167] has extended these variables to account for the use
of computer technology. His extended list visual variables include: location, size, crispness, resolution, transparency, colour value,
colour hue, colour saturation, texture, orientation, arrangement and
shape. Much like MacEachren’s work, the vast majority of research to date on visual variables has focused of their refinement to account for new technology or different context of use
(cf. [35].
There have also been some attempts to transfer Bertin’s concept across to other modalities. Krygier [146] explored the use
of sound as a design variable for the representation of data.
Using Bertin’s work as a reference point, he surveyed the use
of sound as a representational modality in existing systems
to establish the sound variables: location, loudness, pitch, register, timbre, duration, rate of change, order, and attack/decay. Vasconcellos [291] also explored Bertin’s variables, but this time
in relation to tactile cartography. While Vasconcellos translated
Bertin’s principles to a tactual format, she did not identify or
validate any variables that are unique to tactile perception, such
as, for instance, pressure, vibration, or temperature. More recently, in the context of physicalization, Jansen and Hornbæk [124]
have revisited Bertin’s variables, by investigating how people
interpret data encoded in the size of three-dimensional objects.
They present empirical evidence that show physical bars achieve
the same levels of perceptual accuracy as two-dimensional bars.

5.7 recommendations

Apart from Krygiers work on sound variables [146], there has
be no research that has attempted to systematically establish or
validate design variables for representational modalities other
than visual. I have also found no work which seeks to explore
the combination of design variables from different modalities.
For instance, if a representation encodes data in the visual and
physical properties of an artefact, we could leverage the principles developed by Bertin to interrogate and use visual variables,
however, what would be the equivalent variables for the tactile
modality? We could possibly surmise that these would include
pressure, vibration, temperature, texture, weight, shape, or orientation, however, empirical work is needed to establish, confirm
and validate these.
5.7

recommendations

In this section I outline five key recommendations that are meant
to provide practical guidance to other design researchers who
wish to study and create multisensory data representations.
The first highlights issues from a user-centred perspective, the
next three relate to representation and sensory modality, while
the final one needs to be addressed at an interdisciplinary level.
5.7.1

Methods and approach to evaluation

The approach to evaluating the success of multisensory data
representations needs to reflect the purpose of the representation. Although there is on-going research within the InfoVis
research community to investigate how analytical discovery is
made, and how meaning is formed from visualizations, more
attention is needed to evaluate representations whose purpose
is more open-ended. This mirrors the challenges being met by
third-wave HCI researchers [18]. I believe that methods used
in HCI are also applicable to the evaluation of multisensory
data representations that have similar intent, such as evoking
hedonic or emotional responses. Another issue that can be addressed through new approaches to evaluation is the users’
cognitive demand when interpreting data through more than
one modality. Further fundamental research is needed to better understand how multisensory representations impacts on
people’s ability to form meaning from the representation.

123

124

a design space for multisensory data representations

5.7.2

Beyond touch, vision and sound

I have shown that the main representational modalities currently used in multi-sensory data representations are visual,
haptic and sound. I believe that there is potential in harnessing
the perceptual qualities of other modalities to represent data for
all the human senses. Although the use of alternative modalities, such as olfactory or taste may be problematic for generating accurate data insight, combining these with more familiar
ones may yield potential for a truly holistic sensory experience
of data.
5.7.3

Beyond visual variables

It is almost 50 years since Jacques Bertin published his work
on visual variables [13]. The principles he postulated are still
closely adhered today by visualization designers. In order to
effectively harness the attributes (variables) of modalities other
than vision we must first understand how these can be used
to effectively and accurately communicate information. Having
a complete taxonomy of the variables of all modalities will assist researchers and designers to better understand the role that
they play in the representation and interpretation of data. Exploring other modalities in this way may also allow creators of
data representations to complement a variable from one modality with another without causing confusion for the user/audience.
5.7.4

Data insight through experience

During my survey I highlighted a new phenomenon in data
representation, where the data is not encoded in the representational modalities but in the behaviour, affordance and experience of the data representation. I believe that this approach has
the potential to be a key milestone in the evolution of data representation much like the developments in computer technology allowed data representations to be live and dynamic, and
developments in off–the–shelf microcontrollers and rapid prototyping technology allowed data representations to be physical. Presently, the examples that utilize this approach are exploratory pieces created within the Arts. However, as data representations are now commonly used in casual contexts such as
libraries, museums, or at home, facilitating data insight through

5.8 limitations

peoples innate ability to perceive how something feels (experience) is worthy of further exploration. Peter Shenai, one of the
creators of the swing installation My Life Don’t Mean A Thing
If It Ain’t Got That Swing talks about this approach to data representation as allowing him to push the interactive medium to
its limits, up to and including the point of malfunction, as the
malfunction or breakdown of the artefact, in this case a swing,
serves as a reminder to the user that the data has been skewed
strongly in one direction [263]. This is a departure from how
HCI researchers presently think of and address the concept of
(mal)functionality. Alongside this, I believe that representing
data through experience can further harness people’s natural
instincts and can offer researchers a platform to generate data
insight in a more natural and intuitive way.
5.7.5

Multidisciplinary collaboration

The interpretation of data through multiple channels is not exclusive to any one community. My survey shows that it is practiced by a range of professionals and enthusiasts including academics, researchers, designers, artists, engineers and even hobbyists. While acknowledging that intentions may vary greatly, I
see great potential and benefit from encouraging and supporting open collaborations between these disciplines and practitioners. By harnessing the logical and technical skills of information scientists and engineers with the visually perceptive
skills of designers and sensitivity of artists, I believe that data
can be represented in a manner that is artistic, engaging, aesthetic, informative and insightful.
5.8

limitations

In this chapter I presented a design space for multisensory data
representations based on a survey of contemporary and historical examples I collected over time. However, I wish to acknowledge some of the limitations of this survey. First, although I
have attempted to gather as many examples as possible, the
list is not complete, as I may have not been aware of some
works due to their limited exposure. Second, the examples in
the collection have been produced in a wide range of different domains, such as HCI, InfoVis, Art, and Design. This has
meant that the documentation related to each example can vary
dramatically. In research fields such as HCI and InfoVis the de-

125

126

a design space for multisensory data representations

scription of and motivation for creating work is easy to find and
typically quite detailed. Whereas, examples that are situated in
fields, such as, art and design, do not always have easily accessible documentation about the work. In these cases I had to rely
on a combination of 3rd party critiques and my own experience
and interpretation to place the work within the dimensions of
the design space. Finally, I acknowledge that the reader may
object to the dimensions of the present design space and/or
the terminology used to define and describe them. However,
I do not intend this research to be authoritative. The aim of
this research is not to reclassify current data representations or
prescribe a new domain, instead I envisage this work as a catalyst to promote debate, inform design and encourage future
research to move towards a design space for multisensory data
representation.
5.9

chapter summary

In this chapter I defined, for the first time, Multisensory Data
Representation. Using this definition, I collected, collated and
analysed 154 state-of-the-art representations and established a
design space using methods and techniques adopted from Thematic Analysis and Prototype Theory. The three dimensions of
the design space are: use of modalities, representation intent, and
human-data relations. Derived from the analysis of the design
space, I addressed key research issues, including: questioning
the value added by expanding the sensory channels required
to interpret a data representation. I also discussed issues from
the users perspective and explored the boundaries between representation and art. I concluded the discussion by highlighting
underexplored areas and future challenges and then presented
five key recommendations aimed at providing practical guidance to other researchers and practitioners who wish to study
and create multi-sensory data representations.

Part II
METHODOLOGIES AND EXPERIMENTS
In Chapter 3, I highlighted some of the difficulties
associated with capturing people’s experiences with
the methods that are commonly used in HCI, identifying themes common across a group of individuals adds further difficulties due to the subjective
nature of experience. In the context of my own research these issues become even more of an issue as
it is my aim to capture precise accounts of people’s
“lived” experience. In this part of my thesis I introduce two methods (the Repertory Grid and the Elicitation Interview Technique) that are used to elicit accounts of experience and present three studies that
exemplifies the use of these methods in the context
of understanding how people experience data representations. While the Repertory Grid Technique has
been used sparingly in HCI, it is typically conducted
with individual participants and the gathered data
is analysed using quantitative forms of analysis. In
the next chapter I will describe an adaptation to
the technique that allows for the efficient capture
of qualitative data within a group setting. The Elicitation Interview technique, however, has only been
used on a few occasions in HCI and there is no literature that describes its use in evaluating people’s
experience of data. In Chapter 7, I describe this technique and present an empirical study I conducted to
exemplify its use in the context of studying people’s
experience of data representation. The final chapter
in this part is dedicated to presenting a study that
incorporates the Repertory Grid and Elicitation Interview Technique to probe deep into how people
experience tangible data representations.

introduction

The aim of this chapter is threefold; I Data representation has
become a popular tool to facilitate sense-making, discovery and
communication in a large range of professional and casual contexts. However, evaluating their role and impact is still a challenge. In particular, we are lacking techniques to help us understand how representations are experienced by people, moving
beyond usability issues and considering hedonistic, emotional,
and sensory reactions - important aspects when it comes to understanding the role of representation modality as part of analysis processes and insights generation. With this in mind the
aim of this chapter is threefold; I first introduce the Repertory
Grid (RepGrid) technique as method of collecting data on how
people construe their experience of objects, people or events. I
then present my adaptation of the technique, which involves
blending it with a focus group session to allow for the capture
of first-hand accounts of experience during the study. I test this
adaption by conducting a study that seeks to reveal how representational modality affects people’s experience of data. Following this I present an experiment that was designed to validate
and confirm the adaption by comparing two side-by-side RepGrid studies (traditional verses adapted).
Early in my PhD I identified the RepGrid technique as a
useful method to empirically elicit and evaluate people’s subjective experiences and meaning structures [119]. The RepGrid
has been proven to be a valuable technique in phenomenological studies to better understand user experience and the perceived qualities of computational objects (cf. [60] [119]. One of
the main reasons why the RepGrid is useful for this purpose, is
that it provides an established method for eliciting user’s personal constructs, in distinction to other similar methods such
as Semantic differential, which is usually based on predefined,
given constructs [182].

129

130

adapting the repertory grid technique

Early in my studies I envisaged the RepGrid as a method
that would allow me to evaluate the prototypes I created by
capturing accounts of people’s experience of using them. I also
viewed it as a method that would allow me to evaluate multiple prototypes at once by comparing and contrasting people’s
experience of them. However, when I reviewed the literature
on the technique I soon realised that there maybe some limitations with the traditional application, which may impede me
from capturing the type of data that I was seeking (first-hand
accounts of people’s experience). A traditional application of
the RepGrid is conducted with individuals, which can be extremely time-consuming and demanding on the researcher and
participant. The captured data is also typically analysed using
quantitative methods, which excludes the personal remarks of
participants during the study. In this chapter I present my adaptation of technique, which incorporates a focus group session
that allowed me to capture rich qualitative data. The adaptation I present here is a collaboration between my supervisor
and me and has already been described in [103] [104] [106].
While I was responsible for the majority of work, from the design of the studies, over conducted the studies, to analysing
the data, Prof. Dr. Hornecker provided valuable advise on all
phases of the studies. The reason we published the findings
at these conferences was to introduce the adaptation to the
wider research community and to collect expert opinion from
anonymous reviewers and attendees. I now draw these together
to shed further light on the adaption and provide the reader
with an overview of our methodological adaptation that is used
again in final chapter of this thesis. These studies also form
the foundation of my investigation into how representational
modality affects the way people experience data.
6.2

theoretical background

The Repertory Grid technique is a method of collecting data
during a structured, reflective process where the individual participants reveal how they construe their experience of objects,
people or events. Dating back to the mid-1950’s the technique
was first used in a clinical setting, but soon spread to domains
as diverse as Marketing (cf. [173]), Management (cf. [225]) and
Training (cf. [109]). The RepGrid Technique is a methodologically extension of George Kelly’s Personal Construct Theory
(PCT). Kelly proposed this theory as a replacement for the two

6.2 theoretical background

major approaches to human understanding at the time – Behaviourism and Psychodynamics [135]. He suggested that instead of treating people as ’subjects’ we should look at them
as if they are scientists who are continuously trying to make
sense of events around them. They do this by construing and
constructing personal theories that allow them to predicate future encounters and behaviours.
Central to his theory is the idea of the ’construct’. Constructs,
as the name may suggest, are grounded in the psychological
concept of Constructive Alternativism, and are based on the belief that humans draw their understanding and description of
the world based upon their own personal experiences and that
they distil these into labels (Personal Constructs). For instance,
we may judge an event in our lives as ranging from happy to sad,
uplifting to boring, memorable to forgetful and so on. Kelly argued
that - good only has meaning when compared to bad, thus, all
constructs are bipolar dimensions (i.e. happy - sad), therefore a
personal construct is a bipolar dimension of meaning and allows people to compare two or more elements. To illustrate
the idea of ’constructs’ further let me present the following scenario:
John, a married father of new-born twins, discusses buying a new
car with his friend Mark, who is single with no children. Talking
about the criteria that would influence John’s choice, he mentions the
importance of space. John also suggests that he would prefer a car
that was economical to drive and maintain. These are two of John’s
constructs. Reacting to this, Mark explains that these issues would
not concern him (they are not part of his construct system) he would
much rather own a car that offered a faster top speed and ’looked good’.
John goes on to explain that his brother also has a growing family and
he needs the extra space when he goes away on trips. John had formed
his ’space’ construct on the basis of his conversation with his brother,
and this construct is one that he will use when buying a car. Mark
didn’t have that construct, because his experience was different from
John’s; and so he would not have used it when thinking about buying
a new car – at least, not until he starts a family himself, he may then
modify his construct system.

6.2.1

The Fundamental Postulate and the Eleven Corollaries

To amplify his Personal Construct Theory, Kelly affirmed a
fundamental postulate and eleven corollaries. The fundamental postulate states “A person’s processes are psychologically
channelized by the ways in which they anticipate events” [135,
p.46]. This can be interpreted as people’s behaviour is driven by
the way in which he/she anticipates events, or in relation to the
afore-mentioned scenario; John believes that he will need extra
room in his new car for his children based on a conversation
he had with his brother, this will be one of the main criteria he
will use when he decides which car to buy.
The eleven corollaries (see Table 6.1) may be interpreted as
follows: People’s construct systems are composed of bipolar dimensions (Dichotomy corollary: John’s expects his new car to be spacious and not cramped) and these are represented as constructs
(Construction corollary: spacious or cramped). People may be influenced by other people’s constructs (Sociality Corollary: John’s
conversation with his brother). Unlike concepts, constructs are not
used for all things in all circumstances (Range corollary: spacious
or cramped only relates to the interior of the car and not the engine compartment), but some constructs are applicable to many
events (Modulation corollary; spacious or cramped could also relate
to the size of the boot). Constructs are always arranged in a hierarchy (Organization corollary: John places the issue of space ahead
of how economic the car will be), but may be influenced by events
or experience (Experience corollary: in the future John may decide
that space is not as big an issue as how economical the car runs).
People differ from each other in their construction of events
(Individuality corollary: John and Mark have completely different criteria for buying a new car). However, people are similar to the
extent that they see meaning in events similarly (Commonality
corollary: John and Mark both understand why one another have different expectations for a new car). People are also aware that they
may choose either dimension of the construct (Choice corollary:
Mark may also decide that he needs a spacious car), while others
may choose to ignore their personal values (Fragmentation corollary: John may think about reducing some of the extra room for a more
sporty looking car).

The Repertory Grid Technique

George Kelly suggested the Repertory Grid technique as a method
to systematically elicit these personal constructs [135]. Over
time, the technique has been used across many disciplines and
has been extended and customised to best-fit particular contexts of use [71]. However, generally, each variation and adaptation of the technique still maintains three major components:
Elements, Constructs and Links. Elements are the objects, people
or events that are under investigation during the study. The participant, as part of the study, may be asked to select these elements themselves, but in most cases the researcher will provide
the participant with a set of elements. Constructs (described
above) are the bipolar descriptions or attributes that the participant assigns to each element. These constructs are usually
elicited during an interview that takes place after the participant has been made familiar with the elements used in the
study. Links is the method of connecting the elements to the
elicited constructs. Links help to explain how each participant
construe each element relative to elicited constructs and is typically accomplished by rating or ranking the elements against
each personal construct.
In a traditional application of a RepGrid study the researcher
presents participants with elements in groups of three. Once
they have become familiar with the elements they must identify
where two of the elements are similar (Convergent pole) but dissimilar from the third element (Divergent pole). What emerges
is a bipolar dimension (personal constructs), see for instance
PC1 in Table 6.2, this bi-polar dimension ranges from Dynamic
– Stable. Using this bipolar dimension, the participant is asked
to rate all the elements on a 1-7 scale (1: Convergent pole, 7:
Divergent pole). In Table 6.2 the example RepGrid shows that
the participant rated Element A as 2 against PC1 (Dynamic –
Stable) but rated Element B as 7 and C as 6. This rating shows
that the participant construes Element A as being relatively Dynamic but unlike the other two elements which he considers to
be Stable. Once this has been completed a RepGrid (see Table
6.2 for an example RepGrid) is produced that represents how
the participant construes their experience of the elements under investigation.

The RepGrid in Use

While the use of the RepGrid within the HCI community peaked
in the early 1980’s (for a historical overview, see [62], we have
recently seen a resurgence of interest in this technique [61] [92]
[187] [44] [79] [56] [289] [97] [98] [164] [156] [26] [147]). That
being so, the use of the RepGrid in HCI has been less plentiful than in other research fields. The earliest example of its
use in HCI is in 1980, when Quinn investigated the RepGrid
technique as a method to assess cognitive complexity as a correlate of creativity [235]. This was followed by Jerrard[127] who
employed it to analyse design decision-making. More recently,
there have been further attempts to adopt the use of the RepGrid within HCI. Most notably, Hassenzahl and Wessler [93]
suggested that personal constructs, elicited during a RepGrid
study might have the potential to reveal design relevant data.
They note that designers are mainly interested in the differences between products rather than differences in individuals,
thus examining personal constructs elicited from a group of individuals might reveal rich insight about the artefacts that they
interact with. It could be argued that Hassenzahl and Wessler’s
article revitalized interest in the RepGrid technique within HCI.
Since then we have seen the RepGrid technique used in HCI
(and neighbouring fields), such as Cunningham’s attempt to
classify audio within the context of sound design [44], Bang [8]
used it to explore people’s emotional experiences with fabrics,
and Fallman and Waterworth [62] employed it to explore how
people interact with mobile phones.

136

adapting the repertory grid technique

group setting One of the key adaptations to the RepGrid
technique that I present in here is the use of a group session to
elicit personal constructs. Conducting a RepGrid study within
groups is not completely novel; in the past there have been
some varied attempts to incorporate group sessions. The main
concern that all of these approaches have in common is how
can you explore people’s shared meaning or inter-subjectivity,
within an idiographic context. Hall and colleagues conducted
their data gathering with researchers acting as facilitators in a
peer group setting using a process that seems to have been similar to brainstorming [86]. In this study they provided groups
with topics (elements) to discuss, these sessions were facilitated, recorded and transcribed. In the analysis no grid was produced, instead the researcher extracted the themes (constructs)
that they best felt described the topics that were discussed by
the group. Watson used a modified RepGrid study and suggested that grids can provide information about interpersonal
relationships within groups, psychological features of individual group members and changes occurring in individuals taking part in group therapy [307]. More recently McWhinnie and
colleagues [187] used a group session to identify a set of elements to be used in a study, the constructs were then elicited
individually (off site) using a RepGrid kit that the participants
were given. They present an interesting approach to comparing
different individuals grids by pairing participants and getting
them to rate each others grids, they used this in conjunction
with a method suggested by Shaw and Gaines [261] for comparing grids, based on identifying consensus, conflict, correspondence and contrast between participants elicited constructs. The
approach that Alexander and colleagues [5] presents is most
similar to the adaption I present in this chapter. During a workshop session a group of participants elicited both the elements
that would be investigated as well as the constructs that would
be used to rate the elements against. Over a period of two
weeks, group members, independently, and in different places,
assigned values to the cells, which associate constructs with elements. The group then met again to discuss the values that each
assigned to the elements. This session revealed differences in
the individuals’ understanding of the elements and constructs
and made them reconsider their individual interpretations. The
main difference between this approach and mine is the reason
for adapting the RepGrid, which they subsequently renamed
as Reflection Grids, was to explore the technique not as an eval-

6.3 the adaptation

uation tool but as a method to assist team members in collaborating by making the individual concepts (personal constructs)
explicit and hence allowing joint concepts to be formed.
6.2.2.2

RepGrid Limitations

While there is a renewed interest in the RepGrid technique,
there has also being a number of concerns raised recently in
relation to the integrity and application of the technique. Although the RepGrid technique has evolved over time, it is still
predominately used to probe and uncover idiosyncratic views
from individuals. This can be problematic if the objective of the
research is to seek homogeneity across individuals’ perceptions.
In certain cases, researchers, who strive for congruity, found
it difficult to achieve this when employing methods typically
associated with the analysis of RepGrids. Also, although the
data collected during a RepGrid study reveals a lot about what
the participant experienced when interacting with the artefacts
under investigation, it offers very little about why they experienced them in this particular way. In regards to the analysis
of the gathered data, Karapanos and colleagues [129] argued
against averaging as a common practice and instead proposed
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) approach that accounts for
the diverse views. While the data gathered during a typical
RepGrid study can be analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively, it normally lends itself more to the former. It has also
been noted that the procedure of conducted a RepGrid study
is extremely cognitively demanding for both the participants
and the researcher [71]. A comprehensive RepGrid study also
requires a lot of time to organize and conduct, each interview
can take up to 40-minutes to complete and for rigor it is suggested that a study should involve at between 12 and 15 participants [71].
6.3

the adaptation

To address these limitations I designed an adaptation to the
traditional application of the RepGrid technique to allow for
the collection of rich qualitative data in a manner that would
not be exhausting for the participant or researcher. I did, however, seek to maintain the integrity of the original technique
by preserving the fundamental characteristics such as elements,
personal constructs and links. In the following I present this adap-

137

138

tation, which involves blending the RepGrid technique with a
focus group session to investigate people’s experience of representational modality. Instead of analysing the collected data using quantitative methods, I employ discourse analysis to elicit
findings from the study. I follow this by presenting a further experiment, which incorporated two side-by-side studies to valid
the adaption against the typical application of the technique. I
also use this experiment to probe people’s experience of representational modality.
6.3.1

Study 1: Blending the repertory grid technique with focus
groups

The aim of this study to explore how representational modality
affects the way people perceive and interpret data. To accomplish this I employed an adapted approach to RepGrid technique to allow me capture first-hand accounts of people’s experience. The study incorporates a focus group session into
the classical procedure of a RepGrid study, where consensus is
achieved through dialogue between multiple participants. This
dialogue is captured and transcribed and forms a fundamental part of the analysis. I not only propose this methodological
extension but I also present a novel way of analysing RepGrid
data by tracing the emergence and shared meaning through discourse analysis of the transcribed group sessions.
This study explores people’s affective responses when experiencing data represented through different modalities. In
particular, I was interested in investigating how data representations that address haptic/tactile and sonic perception are
experienced. In the following I describe the creation of three
data-driven artefacts that all represent the same dataset. I also
present the procedure followed to elicit the participant’s personal constructs attributed to each artefact during a focus group
session, which form the basis of the group RepGrid. The analysis examines this grid and traces the emergence of one exemplary personal construct as well as highlighting other emergent
themes. The findings consist of a number of elicited constructs
that illuminate how the affective qualities of data driven artefacts relate to the type of modality in use.

6.3 the adaptation

6.3.1.1

Design Process

The goal of the design phase was to produce three data-driven
artefacts that each represents the same dataset. As a first step,
I selected a data source to be represented. The main criteria
was that it must be socially relevant and from a trustworthy
source. A number of datasets were identified that included
economic, environmental, demographic and geographical data.
From these I selected a dataset that represents the latest global
urban outdoor air pollution figures from almost 1100 cities in 91
countries. For the study, the annual mean PM10 ug/m3 for six
countries (Greece: 44, Ireland: 15, India: 109, Egypt: 138, United
Kingdom: 23 and Turkey: 66) were used and all the data-driven
artefacts produced represented this same dataset.
I envisaged the RepGrid study utilizing the ’triad’ technique,
which involves participants identifying a quality dimension of
three given objects, such that two of the objects are similar in
some way and the third is relatively dissimilar [71]. For this
reason, three modalities were identified and a prototype was
designed for each. These are: SonicData (auditory modality),
DataBox (cross-modal (haptic and auditory)) and a Bar Graph
(visual modality) (see Figure 6.1). Besides using different representational modalities, two of the artifacts (DataBox and SonicData) require active manipulation to elicit information, whereas
the Bar Graph only requires the participants to look at it. Also,
SonicData and the Bar Graph both use a single modality to represent the data, with SonicData utilizing an alternative modality
to the ’standard’ visual modality. DataBox is defined as employing a cross-modal representation. Cross-modal, in the context
of this research, uses more than one modality to represent the
same data. Its use of the different senses allows the characteristics of one sensory modality to be transformed into stimuli for
another sensory modality [158].
SonicData is a bespoke device that represents data by playing sonic tones at certain frequencies through a tactile interface.
Users of SonicData are presented with a labelled surface and a
small coloured wooden cube. Placing the cube over each label
triggers a sound whose frequency represents the urban air pollution of this country. The frequency is mapped to the level of
air pollution; high pollution results in a high frequency sound
and low pollution will result in a low sound, e.g. 1380 Hertz

(Egypt) and 150 Hertz (Ireland).
DataBox is a wireless cube device (10cm3) created for this
study, which represents the dataset through haptic and auditory feedback. The six faces of the cube represent the six countries of the dataset. When the user hovers each face over a
scanning station, an LCD display located within this station
shows the name of the selected country. DataBox immediately
responds by knocking on the internal walls. The rate of knocks
corresponds to the level of air pollution, e.g. 15 times per minute
(Ireland) and 138 times per minute (Egypt). DataBox consists
of a microcontroller and 12-volt solenoid housed inside a hollow wooden box, and has RFID tags on the inside of each face.
When hovering the box over a RFID reader it reads the closest
tag, sends a message to the LCD, and wirelessly transmits a
message to the microcontroller that controls the knocking.
The Bar Graph utilized a common and recognisable visualization format. The printed graph (42cm x 21cm) was labelled
with the names of the six countries on the x-axis and the data
was represented using solid black bars on the y-axis. I was conscious that including such a recognisable format might influence participant’s responses, especially considering the unique
nature of the other prototype. However, the rationale for including such a standard format was to remind the participants that
they were interacting with artefacts that serve the purpose of
representing data.
6.3.1.2

Participants and Procedure

Fifteen individuals (11 male) participated in the study, with a
mean age of 22 years (Min = 19, Max = 24). The participants
were all final-year digital media students and members of the
same class and thus were already accustomed to discussing top-

6.3 the adaptation

ics in front of one another during group critiques. It was a conscious decision to involve a group of participants who knew
each other already and would feel comfortable discussing their
personal experiences in front of each other. The session took
place in a large room with all three artefacts located at separate
corners of the room. The study entailed, firstly, dividing the
group into three subgroups. The subgroups then had 15 minutes to engage with each of the data artefacts (45 minutes in
total). This was followed by a group discussion, which I facilitated and involved all 15 participants. The study was recorded
using three video cameras directed at each artefact and three
digital audio recorders positioned alongside each artefact. Transcripts were produced from audio files recorded during the familiarisation sessions and formed the basis of the analysis.
The following sections briefly describe the phases followed
during a typical RepGrid study, and then highlights the variations to these while conducting my adapted study. For the
purposes of this study, three artefacts (SonicData, DataBox and
the Bar Graph) were pre-selected, providing the elements to be
examined. Participants are made familiar with the elements before the phase of construct elicitation begins. A typical RepGrid
study would normally conclude by having the participants rate
each of the elements on a 5-7 scale for each construct. This
study did not include this stage, as the main objective was to
reveal the emergence of these constructs through an inductive
approach to the analysis.

element familiarization This stage allows for the participants to become familiar with the elements used in the study.
The researcher typically introduces each participant to the elements and allows some time to interact with these. Generally
this phase of a RepGrid study is quite informal and not treated
as of critical importance. However, for the study presented here
this phase was central. Following a short introduction to the
three data artefacts, all participants were allowed 45 minutes to
interact with them. The participants were divided into groups
of four, spending fifteen minutes interacting with each data
artefact before moving on to the next in a round-robin pattern.
All groups were encouraged to openly discuss their perception
and experience as well as discussing the pertinent qualities of

the artefacts with each other.

construct elicitation During this stage, participants are
normally interviewed individually to elicit personal constructs.
Instead, in this study a group discussion was conducted (see
fig. 6.2), which I mediated. The method used in this session was
the minimum-context triad form of construct elicitation. From
a triad of elements the participants are asked to describe how
two elements are similar (Convergent pole) but differ from the
third (Divergent pole). This dimension is the personal construct.
The session commenced by asking participants to write down
as many personal constructs as they could think of. After a few
minutes they were asked to explain their constructs aloud and
the group openly discussed each of these. This discussion also
generated further new constructs. These were elicited by the researcher ’laddering’ the discussion by asking participants ’why’
certain constructs are important to them [43]. Constructs were
only recorded if the majority of the participants agreed. This
process was repeated until participants could no longer think
of meaningful distinctions or similarities among the triad of
artefacts.
6.3.1.3

Findings

The analysis went through four steps, from filtering and collapsing the elicited constructs, over classifying them as ergonomic
or experience-oriented (hedonic) to tracing their emergence and
finally highlighting major themes exposed during the study.

6.3 the adaptation

filtering In total 35 sets of bi-polar constructs were elicited
during the group discussion session. For this analysis, the list
was shortened to 27 constructs by collapsing those that were semantically related into one construct. For example I collapsed
the constructs Novel and Innovative into the one construct (Novel).
classification As the objective of the study was to examine the participants affective responses, I focused the analysis
on constructs that demonstrate affective or hedonic qualities
(cf. [93]) rather than ergonomic qualities (task-orientated and
related to traditional usability principles such as efficiency). Hedonic quality (HQ) comprises of quality dimensions with no
obvious relation to tasks, such as novelty, innovativeness, attractiveness etc. [93]. From the list of 26 sets of constructs, 13 were
classified as HQ. The RepGrid (Table 6.3) shows the elicited
(HQ) personal constructs (PC1-13). It illustrates, for instance,
that the group characterized both DataBox and SonicData as
’Novel’ but unlike the Bar Graph, which was characterized as
being ’Familiar’ (PC1). They also agreed that SonicData and the
Bar Graph should be described as ’Organic’ whereas DataBox
was ’Artificial’ (PC13).
tracing The objective at this stage was to trace the emergence of the hedonic constructs in order to better understand
the meaning associated with these constructs. This was achieved
by examining the transcribed familiarization and group session
as well as field notes taking during and after the study. It is important to note that as part of this study the field notes were
an integral element and were used as a step toward data analysis [200]. To demonstrate this process, in the following I trace
the emergence of PC3 (Instinctual—Cerebral).
Table 6.3 shows the group agreed that DataBox and SonicData should be described as Instinctual whereas the Bar Graph
was described as Cerebral. This reliance on instinct was evident
during the Familiarisation Session. While interacting with the
DataBox and SonicData, the participants were continuously seeking real-world analogies for further insight into the artefacts.
On numerous occasions, participants in all three familiarisation
sub-groups compared the output from DataBox to the characteristics of living beings, such as “It’s like a heartbeat”, “It feels
like it is dying”, “India is dead”. One participant also remarked
that the knocking on the box could be compared to “the pump-

ing of our lungs and the beating of our heart”. The participants
also used real-world analogies while using SonicData, however,
these tended to be more artificial in nature, the following extract illustrates this point:
P3: Greece sounds like a dialling tone.
P2: The UK is kind of nice, it sounds like a small ship.
P5: Yeah, like a sonar.
P2: No, it sounds like you are dialling a phone.
P1: Then the high-pitched ones are the highest ones.
During the Construct Elicitation session the group explained
this personal construct further by describing the graph as a
thing that you have to learn to use. They explained how they
have been taught to use bar graphs throughout their education
and they see them merely as tools; one participant remarked
“You can tell instantly which is the worst of which is the best - there
is no confusion, you do not have to look any further”. The mapping
used in the other artefacts, however, were new to the partici-

pants. They spoke about not having any prior training in the
use of these and having to rely on their instinct to understand
what the output represented.
6.3.1.4

Themes

Based on the analysis of the transcripts against the RepGrid produced during the focus group session I identified four themes
(Linguistic, Consequences verses Implications, The Felt Dimension and Rating) that shed light on how representational modality affected participant’s experience of the data.
linguistic An interesting theme that emerged from the study
was that the language used by participants while interacting
with the DataBox and SonicData was, in general, more emotive
than with the Bar Graph. There was frequent use of expressive
descriptions such as: annoying, hurts, beautiful, healthy, alarming, relaxing, dead, urgent, fun, torture, irritating and intense;
used in relation to the DataBox and SonicData that was not evident in the conversations about the Bar Graph.
causation verses affect It was also found that the group’s
discussion when using the Bar Graph during the familiarisation
session generally related to speculating about the causes of pollution, whereas discussions around the other artefacts generally
related to the effect that poor pollution has on the inhabitants of
the countries. This is highlighted in the following extract from
the familiarization session:
[Bar Graph]
P1: . . . It looks like poorer countries have more pollution than richer
countries.
P2: yes
P3: but why is Egypt more polluted than India?
P2: but isn’t India poorer
P3: that has got nothing to do with the air?
P2: but generally poor countries are more polluted as they have so
many people there. . .
[SonicData]
P3: . . . the sound of each is so annoying
P4: imagine living in Egypt, it would be pretty annoying to have such
pollution also
P5: as well as India.

145

146

adapting the repertory grid technique

P3: Greece is by far my most favorite one
P2: No, mine is the United Kingdom...
[DataBox]
P12: . . . that could be healthy Ireland?
P11: Healthy Ireland! No, cause if my heart was beating that slow I
would be almost dead
P13: Yes, but what we are feeling at the moment is Egypt
P12: Yeah, but that feels healthy
P13: Yeah, that sounds good, it sounds like progress, it sounds like it’s
going well. . .

the felt dimension Another theme to emerge was the
participants way of phrasing how they experienced and interpreted the data artefacts. When using the DataBox they talked
about “feeling” the data and associated it with a human-heartbeat.
On occasions when the frequency of knocks decreased, the participant holding the DataBox remarked that they felt the country was “dying”. Affective responses were also evident with
SonicData. Participants described some of the sounds as being
“annoying” or “painful” and equated unpleasant sounds with
increased pollution.
rating Also, in relation to SonicData, the participants spoke
about which sound was their favourite, and used this as an
attempt to map the least and most polluted countries. The following exchange exemplifies this:
P5: I like that one the best [Greece].
P8: I like that one [UK].
P5: What’s next, Turkey, India and Egypt.
P7: Think about it though, what is the nicest to listen to?
P5: Greece is nice.
P7: I like the UK.
P8: The lower ones are nice so the pollution must be low.
P5: Yes, I like the lower ones.

These behaviours may be interpreted as the participant’s affectively responding to the DataBox and SonicData in a manner that was not evident with the Bar Graph. While I did expect the responses from the DataBox and SonicData to be more

6.3 the adaptation

extreme than the Bar Graph, given this format does not leave
much space for interpretation, the acute difference in the style
of language used by the participants when describing their experience was noticeable and somewhat unexpected.
The affective response to DataBox and SonicData is furthermore reflected in the RepGrid (Table 6.3), where participants
tended to associate these more often with what could be considered the more emotional and fun-related pole of a construct
(e.g. primal, fun, warm, playful, immersive). Interestingly, SonicData was considered artificial (and not organic).
6.3.1.5

Other Observations

During the familiarisation session I observed a distinct difference in how the three groups situated themselves and moved
around the artefacts. While interacting with DataBox and SonicData the members of a group were continuously switching positions in order to interact with the artefacts but also to observe
others interacting with the artefacts. This was not evident with
any group at the Bar Graph. In this case, all members of a group
stood motionless in front of the graph until they were asked
to move to another artefact. I also noted that when a member of the group talked about DataBox and SonicData that the
other members sought to maintain eye contact throughout the
discussion. This could be described as an attempt to discover
more about what others were saying and feeling as they used
the artefacts. Conversely, when the groups were viewing the
Bar Graph they tended to consistently look at the graph, even
when other members were speaking. In this case, the choice
of representation might contribute to this behaviour pattern –
the Bar Graph representation has an orientation, and even if it
would be on a piece of paper on the table, it would not be as
easy for the group to surround it as this was for the other two
data artefacts.
While this study highlights evidence which supports the case
that representing data using non-visual artefacts evokes more
affective responses, I also observed that the participants had
some difficulty mapping the data to the representational output, for example, whether frequent knocking (DataBox) represented a high or low rate of pollution. In the early stages
of the session participants spent some time discussing this is-

sue. However, once consensus was met, the conversation soon
switched to issues related to the source of the dataset.
6.3.2

Discussion and Summary

This study investigated people’s affective responses when experiencing data represented through different types and levels
of modalities. I explored this by conducting an adapted RepGrid study using three data-driven artefacts, which each represented the same dataset. During a focus session with fifteen
participants, thirty-five personal constructs were elicited. For
the purpose of analysis this list was shortened to thirteen that
demonstrated a hedonic quality. It is clear from this list that
the participants perceived DataBox and SonicData as being more
similar than the Bar Graph. Apart from the obvious novel characteristics of these artefacts over the familiar format of the Bar
Graph, we also believe that the interactive quality of these artefacts influenced the participants to see them as more alike.
In the analysis I chose one personal construct Instinctual—Cerebral
and traced its emergence using field notes and transcriptions
from the group session. This analysis reveals that the participants relied heavily on instinct, previous experiences and realworld analogies to infer data insight and meaning from both
DataBox and SonicData. Conversely, the participants found that
the Bar Graph is a tool they have been trained to use over a
long period and thus did not engage them emotionally. They
tended to have more abstract, causality-oriented discussions
about the content of the Bar Graph, whereas they were more
concerned about what the data represented by the DataBox and
SonicData would mean for people’s lives, and used more emotive language to describe the data.
This study shows that, given a group that is comfortable discussing with each other, a group approach to the RepGrid can
be useful, in particular, in allowing us to trace the emergence of
constructs from participant’s direct initial responses to the elements. In the next section I present a study that sought to validate this adaptation, which was also conducted for the purpose
of exploring people’s experience of representational modality.

Study 2: Comparing the approaches and confirming the adaptation

In the previous study I showed how the traditional application
of the RepGrid technique could be adapted to collect rich accounts of experience instead of numerical ratings. In the study
I describe next I continue with the same line of enquire and also
valid and confirm the adaption of the technique. I also sought
to address some of he limitations of the previous study, these include the clear disparage between the visual modality and the
other two. I sought to reduce the design features of the three
artefacts to focus the participant’s attention on the representational modalities and away from other aspects such as interaction styles, aesthetics and materials. With these issues in mind
I designed an experiment that would incorporate two studies,
each of which investigated the same set of artefacts. One would
follow the procedure and methods of analysis of a traditional
RepGrid study, while the other would incorporate the adaption described in the previous sections. In comparing these approaches, I will illustrate how using a blended approach can
validate and reveal further meaning about the data collected.
Furthermore, I will demonstrate that this can be achieved in
a more natural manner than that of a typical RepGrid study,
which can be extremely demanding for both the participant and
the researcher while the study is being conducted.

6.3.3.1

Methodology and Data-Driven Interfaces

As part of this study a new set of data-driven interfaces were
created that represent one data stream through the haptic, visual and auditory modalities. The source of the data is a live
stream of the Hydrogen levels in deep Space. This data is gathered by Blackrock Castle Observatory and the Irish National Space
Centre, both based in Cork, Ireland. The rationale for using this
source was that I have worked with this data in the past (see
Chapter Four) and it has proven to be a reliable and constant
stream of data. To acquire the data I utilized a commercial
cloud based data collection and retrieval system (COSM). A
custom program on the computer attached to the telescope collects the latest data and sends it to an account on COSM, and
then any computer connected to the Internet can retrieve and
utilize this data (see Fig. 6.3:4).

Haptic interface e. Visual interface.

When designing the three data representation interfaces I prioritised simplicity and clarity, and envisaged producing three
prototypes whose primary function was to represent the data
via a particular modality.

the haptic interface represents the data through the
haptic modality utilizing vibro-tactile feedback (see Fig. 6.3:3).
It consists of a 30cm x 30cm wooden surface that comfortably
accommodates only two hands. The rationale for such a size
was that all three modal interfaces should be similar in regards
to the number of people who could interact with them at any
one time. Nevertheless, as Fig. 6.3:3 illustrates, participants figured out ways to share the experience by putting their hands
close together on the board. The vibration is generated through
ten 5-volt motors that are embedded into the underside of the
wood. The speed of these motors is controlled by a microcon-

6.3 the adaptation

troller that is connected wirelessly to a computer. Through a
custom program, a constant connection is maintained with the
COSM server where the latest value retrieved from the radio
telescope is stored. The speed of the motors increases or decreases depending on the latest reading (high levels cause strong
vibration while low levels cause weak vibrations).
the visual interface represents the data through a range
of colours, from green to red, which is emitted from six RGB
LED’s. The interface consists of a hollow wooden cube (10cm
side) with a 2cm hole in the top face (Fig. 6.3:2). A microcontroller, which is housed in the interior of the cube, controls
the colour of the light being emitted from the LED’s. It is connected wirelessly to the same program as the haptic interface.
When the program captures high values it instructs the microcontroller to emit red light from the LED’s. If, however, the
reading is low, it instructs the LED’s to glow green. Values inbetween these two extremes cause the LED’s to emit the range
of colours in the colour spectrum between red and green (i.e.
medium values triggers purple light, medium-high values triggers orange light and so on), Fig. 6.3:1 shows a selection of
different colour ranges emitted from the cube.
the auditory interface utilizes a custom program that
dynamically generates a digital sound and plays this through
a set of head-phones. The headphones are connected to a computer running the program all the interfaces are connected to.
The frequency of this sonic tone represents the latest data values. When the program reads the latest value from the COSM
server it translates this value into a certain frequency. The higher
the Hydrogen values the higher the frequency of the tone and
visa versa.
6.3.3.2

Procedure

In all, 24 individuals (8 female) participated in both studies,
with a mean age of 24 (Min = 21, Max = 28). They were also
final-year digital media students, but none participated in the
previous study. Initially, the participants were divided into two
groups of 12, with one group participating in Study 1 (the traditional RepGrid approach) and the other in Study 2 (the blended
approach). Both studies were conducted in a large room, where
the three data interfaces were positioned in separate corners.
The follow-on interviews and focus group session also took

151

152

adapting the repertory grid technique

place in the same location. The following sections describe the
procedure followed by both studies, divided into the various
stages of a RepGrid study (Element Familiarization, Construct
Elicitation and Rating.) In each case I will first describe the typical traditional procedure and follow this by presenting the proposed amendment.
6.3.3.3

Element Familiarization Session

study 1 (traditional): This stage of the study is dedicated to making the participant familiar with the elements that
are under investigation. I introduced each participant to the elements separately and allowed some time for him/her to interact with them. At all times there was only one participant and
I in the room. Following a short explanation of each interface,
each of the 12 participants was allowed 15 minutes to engage
with all three elements. I was present in the room at all times to
answer any questions, while also encouraging the participants
to move between all the interfaces and not to stay with one for
too long.
study 2 (blended): In a typical RepGrid study this stage
is quite informal, however, as part of my proposed blending
of the two methods this stage was of critical importance. Following a short introduction to the three data interfaces, all 12
participants were allowed 45 minutes to interact with them. The
participants were divided into groups of four, spending fifteen
minutes interacting with each interface before moving on to
the next in a round-robin pattern. All groups were encouraged
to openly discuss their perception and experience as well as
discussing the pertinent qualities of the interfaces with each
other. This session was recorded using video cameras and audio recording equipment. The transcriptions of these recordings form the central component of the subsequent analysis.
6.3.3.4

Construct Elicitation

study 1 (traditional): During a typical RepGrid study,
following the familiarization session, the individual participants
are interviewed separately to elicit their personal constructs.
The method we used is the minimum-context triad form of construct elicitation. From the triad of elements each participant
was asked to describe how two elements are similar (convergent pole) but different from the third (divergent pole). This

6.3 the adaptation

continued until the participant was noticeably having difficulties in ascribing new and unique attributes to the elements. In
cases where the participant found it difficult to elicit more than
five constructs I would repeat some of the recorded constructs
and ask them ’why’ this attribute is important to them. This
method, known as ’laddering’, assists the participant in defining the constructs further and in many cases leads to new constructs being elicited [43]. Research has shown that the amount
of constructs elicited during a RepGrid study typically ranges
from 5 – 17 [71]. In the 12 sessions conducted during this study
an average of 11 constructs were elicited from participants.
study 2 (blended): In the blended approach, instead of
interviewing the participants individually, I conducted a focus group session, to elicit constructs from the group. I also
used the minimum-context triad form of construct elicitation
in this session. It commenced by asking all 12 participants to
write down as many personal constructs as they could think
of, much like the typical RepGrid study. After a few minutes
participants were asked to explain their constructs aloud and
the group openly discussed each of these. Although the group
were in control of which constructs were discussed at length,
if I felt that the discussion was not progressing the laddering
technique was also used. A personal construct (or possibly now
these could be called ’group construct’) was only recorded if the
majority of the group agreed with its inclusion. Once the group
achieved consensus, I recorded the construct on a large whiteboard in the room. This process was repeated until the group
could no longer think of meaningful distinctions or similarities
among the triad of elements. This session was also recorded
using video and audio equipment, and was subsequently transcribed for use in the analysis of the study.
6.3.3.5

Ratings

study 1 (traditional): Typically the third and final stage
of a RepGrid study is dedicated to linking the elicited constructs to the elements under investigation. This is done by
rating or ranking each element against each construct until a
completed RepGrid is produced (see Table 6.4). In this study
each participant was presented with a printout of their RepGrid, which consisted of their bipolar constructs displayed in
the rows and the elements in the columns. The participant was
then asked to rate (Likert scale 1-7) each element against the

153

154

adapting the repertory grid technique

constructs so that 1 being the convergent pole (left) and 7 being
the divergent pole (right). Once this had been completed the
participants were asked to read over the grid and confirm that
they agreed with it.
study 2 (blended): In the blended approach, the group
of participants were not asked to rate elements. Instead, they
were asked to dichotomize, meaning that each element was either one dimension of the construct or the other (George Kelly
used this approach in the first RepGrid studies [135]). This process involved all participants discussing and debating whether
each element belongs at the convergent or divergent pole of the
dimension. Once consensus was achieved, the group decision
was recorded by the researcher i.e. the visual modality is construed as comfortable but the haptic and auditory modality are
construed as uncomfortable (See Table 6.5 (S2A)). Again, this
part of the study was recorded, transcribed and used as part of
the analysis.
6.3.3.6

Data Processing

The proposed adaption also extends into the analysis of the
data gathered during study. During a typical RepGrid study
a grid is produced for each participant, these can be analysed
as individual grids or condensed into one group-grid by using
various quantitative and qualitative methods. In our adapted
approach only one grid is ever produced. The following sections provide a description of the procedure of processing the
data gathered during both studies. First, I will present the traditional approach, this will be followed by illustrating the methods used as part of my adaption.
study 1 (traditional): The overall aim of processing the
data from a traditional RepGrid study is to compress the individual grids (12 in this case) into one group-grid. During the
study a total of 130 unique personal constructs were elicited by
the 12 participants, these constructs were input into the software application WebGrid 51 , which was developed to handle
data gathered during a RepGrid study. This application uses
FOCUS analysis to sort the grid, which shows the highest possible correlation between constructs and elements. This is accomplished by reordering the rows (constructs) and columns (ele1 see http://gigi.cpsc.ucalgary.ca:2000/

ments) to produce a FOCUSed grid that places the constructs
and elements that are statically similar to one another next to
each other [262]. By using this FOCUSed grid I was able to identify certain clusters of constructs that were statistically similar
or identical to other constructs. For the purpose of this study I
applied two rules when identifying clusters: firstly, constructs
must be statistically >95% similar and secondly, a cluster must
include four or more constructs. My analysis identified 13 clusters, which incorporated 105 different constructs. The remaining 25 constructs were not statistically similar enough to be part
of a cluster.
The next stage involves providing titles for the clusters. To
exclude researcher bias, each cluster was given the title from a
construct within that particular cluster, for example the cluster
Comfortable – Uncomfortable includes the constructs (smooth,
appealing, relaxing, comfortable) and (piercing, dull, agitated,
uncomfortable). Then, the ratings of each cluster were calculated. Instead of the arithmetic mean, the median value was
calculated. I used the median value as studies have shown
that calculating the arithmetic mean understates extreme val-

155

156

adapting the repertory grid technique

ues, which may be at odds with the majority of participants.
Following this, the repertory grid was produced that included
13 bipolar clusters (Table 6.4). The final stage of data processing
involves producing a map using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA). This further helps to reveal trends and clusters within
the data (see Fig. 6.4) PCA is normally relied on heavily during
quantitative analysis of RepGrid data [71].
study 2 (blended): The adapted approach requires minimal processing of the data, as the participants themselves complete this through discussion and debate during the focus group
session. In all, a total of 24 constructs (group constructs) were
elicited during the focus group session. To refine this list, I also
input the list into WebGrid 5, which produced a repertory grid.
As the elements were dichotomized against each construct and
did not apply ratings, the rules we applied to reveal clusters in
this grid were much more severe than in the traditional approach. These rules were as follows: the constructs must be
statistically identical (100%) to each other, while also being semantically similar, i.e. the bipolar constructs engaging – nonengaging, exciting – relaxing and stimulating – non-stimulating
were conflated into one cluster which we titled Stimulating –
Non-Stimulating. The final repertory grid that was produced
can be seen in Table 6.5.
6.3.3.7 Comparing The Grids
Before I present the analysis of the grids I will briefly compare the content of the two repertory grids produced. There
are a number of clear similarities between the two grids (Table.
6.4 and 6.5). I have reordered both grids to highlight possible
similarities. The first nine constructs (A-I) can be pared with a
counterpart on the other grid, from S1A and S2A (Comfortable
– Uncomfortable) to S1I and S2I (Clear-Confusing and ObviousAbstract). From these nine pairs there are first four are almost
identical, whereas the remaining five we classified as semantically similar. To verify these similarities and avoid researcher
bias I used a thesaurus as well as consulting with a number of
colleagues who were not part of this research. I note that there
is a similarity in 65% of the elicited constructs; this however
leaves 5 constructs that do not demonstrate any resemblance to
constructs elicited using the other approach.

6.3.3.8

Grid Analysis

In presenting the analysis of both studies it is not my intention
to be exhaustive; I am more concerned with highlighting the
key aspects of the analysis as a means to compare my adaptation to a traditional RepGrid study. Before I describe the proposed adaption to analysing RepGrid data - which is integral
to my proposed blended approach, I will first briefly illustrate
a typical method of analysing the data through Principle Components Analysis.
study 1 (traditional): Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
is a distance-based method of analysing RepGrid data. It produces a PCA map that illustrates the degrees of correlation between and among constructs and elements, by calculating the
statistical distance between them. The first component (x-axis)
of the PCA map (Fig. 6.4) accounts for 61.7% of the variance
and together with the second, 38.3% (y-axis), it identifies 100%
of variance in the data. Although this is extremely high, it is
not unexpected as there were only 3 elements used in the study.
When I examined these two components it can be interpreted as
the first being related to type or level of engagement the participants thought they had with the interfaces. Constructs close to
this axis include: curious, engaging, provocative and intriguing.
The other component we read as being related to the material
and sensory qualities of the elements, whether they felt comfortable or un-comfortable and also whether they stimulated
more than one sense (multimodal) or not (mono-modal).
The PCA map also reveals three strong clusters formed close
to each modality. Firstly, a dimension of the cluster (Aesthetic,
Calming) is closely grouped with the visual modality. It could
be inferred from this that the participants considered the visual
modality not only to be highly aesthetic and extremely calming, but that the other modalities (haptic and auditory) are not
seen as demonstrating these attributes. We could also surmise
participants associate a sense of calming with aesthetic qualities as they are tightly clustered on the map. I also highlight a
possible anomaly close to this cluster in regards to the positioning of the construct: Stimulating. From a semantic perspective,
this attribute would seem to contradict the construct Calming,
which is close by. In the case where we have two constructs
that are statistically similar, but demonstrate very little semantic similarities, I would need to return to the participants to

question the meaning of this, as I do not have any data that
can shed further light on this issue. The other clusters include
(Multi-modal, Tangible) which is clustered around the haptic
modality and (Abstract, Virtual, Typical), which form a cluster
close to the auditory modality. The positioning and clustering
of these attributes can be used to develop further understanding about how the participants construe their experience of the
modalities under investigation in this study.

study 2 (blended): As can be seen above, a RepGrid study
is typically analysed using a combination of quantitative (FOCUS and PCA) and qualitative methods (Content Analysis). In
adapting this procedure, I propose taking a primarily qualitative approach. This procedure involves transcribing and analysing
the familiarization and focus group sessions as examples of discourse. This discourse was treated as relating to the experience

6.3 the adaptation

Figure 35: Principal Component Analysis of the Group Grid.

of using the three interfaces. The process I employed involves
tracing the emergence of the elicited constructs through the discourse to reveal further insight related to their meaning. I will
also demonstrate how this technique can be used to validate
the grid and extract constructs that were not elicited during
the study. The accounts are also scrutinized for the kind of discovery that might be useful in informing the design of data
representations. Along with the transcripts, we also examined
our field notes compiled during and after the study.

6.3.3.9

Discussion

In the focus group session, it was agreed that both the haptic
and auditory interfaces be described as Stimulating, unlike the
visual interface which they agreed was Non-Stimulating (see
Table 6.5 S2C). When we examined the transcripts we found
extracts that concur with this choice of construct. On one occasion, when a group were interacting with the haptic interface
their discussion was as follows:

159

160

adapting the repertory grid technique

P1: But when this one (haptic) goes from low to high you notice much
more than the visual one, it makes you think more because it grabs
your attention.
P4: ...I would much prefer the sensation in my hand.
P2: Yeah true, but would you really know that it was at the highest.
P4: Does that matter, as long as it is grabbing your attention well
then it works, vibration works better than lights for me...
We can see in this extract that the participants are comparing the two modalities (haptic and visual) and negotiate the
importance of stimulation, while some are willing to trade the
communicative value of the modality for stimulation. Participant 4 even qualifies whether the interface works or not purely
on the basis of it “grabbing your attention.”
Another construct elicited during the study was Sociable –
Isolating (see Table 6.5 S2K). The group described the haptic
and visual modality as being Sociable while describing the auditory modality as being Isolating. The following extract provides a rationale for ascribing these constructs to the elements.
P6: None of us have any idea what the levels are when we are not
using the headphones, at least with the other we can push in beside
someone else to see the colours and we all had our hands on the vibration mat at one time.
P8: That is not just down to the headphones, I have my own idea of
what certain sounds mean, but that is not the same for colours
P6: You can also think about it more without some-one asking you
about it...
P8: ...This one (audio) is different from the other ones, I’d say
P7: Yeah, it’s the only one that you have to make your own mind
up about what’s going on, the others you can look around a see what
other people think but this one you have to explain what you feel first
before can gauge what others think...
This discourse is referencing aspects that could be construed
as generating shared meaning (Sociable) within a group:
P7: look around a see what other people think”, as well as including
dialogue that points toward purely independent thoughts (Isolating)
P8: I might perceive some-thing different from you.

6.3 the adaptation

I believe these extracts highlight an important issue related to
the meaning of the construct, as it rather seems to describe the
(incidental) properties of the interface, and not the modalities
used to represent the data. The auditory modality is the only
one that cannot be experienced by more than one person at a
time. The haptic modality is carried through a vibrating surface, and contrary to our design intention, which was to only
support single user interaction, it did afford multiple hands
to be placed on the surface at once. The visual modality was
also designed to only support single user interaction. However,
although the opening in the cube is quite small, the participants soon realized that by placing a hand over the opening
the colour is reflected for all to see. Although all interfaces were
designed for only one person, the audio interface was the only
one that maintained this, leading us to believe that this is the
reason why the group considered it to be isolating and not sociable like the other interfaces.
The group also agreed to describe the visual interface as aesthetic, while describing the haptic and auditory modalities as
practical (see Table 6.5 S2B). During the discussions participants
in one of the groups spoke about the visual interface in the following way:
P9: I think it is really pretty, pretty colours I mean
P12: Yeah, it is prettier than the sound one
P11: That’s because you can’t possibly describe sounds as pretty
P10: Yes you can, the sound of little birds chirping can be pretty
P8: That is because the birds are also pretty and not just the sounds
they make
P9: Well you surely can not say a vibration is pretty
P12: That’s true...
It is clear from this conversation that members of the group
explicitly ascribed aesthetic qualities to the visual modality itself. They were not concerned with the physical container that
the colours were being projected in. They also question whether
abstract sounds and the sensation of vibration can be considered pretty.
Another group, while viewing the visual interface, discussed:

161

162

adapting the repertory grid technique

P4: What is causing that?
P2: I don’t know
P3: Neither do I
P2: But I don’t really care what’s causing it, isn’t it enough just to
know that something is causing it...
P4: What do you mean?
P2: It’s creating these lovely colour changes and that’s enough for me
P4: That’s not all it’s doing
P2: I know but sometimes it is nice just to look at cool things happening and not bother about why it’s happening
P4: It’s pretty cool alright...
We see here that when the participants engaged with a modality, which they perceive as aesthetically pleasing, the communicative value of the modality becomes somewhat irrelevant.
When participant 4 states that he doesn’t “really care what’s
causing it”, he is challenged by participant 2, but reaffirms his
position and explains that “sometimes it is nice just to look at
cool things”.
These are three examples of how we trace the emergence and
explore further meaning of the constructs through the dialogue
recorded during the study. It not only provides us with a better understanding of the underlying meaning of the constructs,
but we can also use this discourse to validate the constructs and
possible even extract new constructs that were not elicited during the study. An example of the emergence of a new construct
during analysis follows.
When the transcripts were examined I noticed that on a number of occasions the participants described the visual and haptic
modality as being harsh and alarming, while comparing them
to the soothing and smooth qualities of the auditory modality.
On one occasion the group agreed when participants 4 stated
“the light on your eyes is very harsh especially when it gets
to red”. Another example can be seen in the following extract
(which was recorded while the group were interacting with the
auditory modality):
P1: It’s much smoother than the lightbox
P4: what do you mean by smoother?
P1: I mean, it’s more soothing
P2: I wouldn’t say that the colours were alarming, maybe a bit harsh

6.3 the adaptation

on your eyes but this was only when I look really closely at it
P4: I find with this one is not as harsh as the other two and that makes
you want to listen to it for longer...
Following this discovery the research team agreed to add the
construct harsh – soothing to the group RepGrid (see Table 6.5
S2O).

6.3.3.10

Themes

As well as tracing the emergence of the elicited constructs and
revealing new constructs, a number of themes emerged from
the transcripts. In this section I highlight three exemplar themes
that are grounded in the gathered data, Referencing the lifeworld, Misunderstanding multimodal feedback and Visualizing
non-visual modalities. This analysis is not meant to be exhaustive; it is merely presented to illustrate the potential of blending
both approaches to reveal rich design relevant insight.
Referencing the lifeworld: When examining the transcripts I
noticed, on many occasions, the participants seeking analogies
with objects they encounter in their daily lives to help them describe the experience of the three interfaces. Examples include
one participant describing the haptic feedback as being: “like a
washing machine when it’s spinning very slow”. Another participant spoke about the visual feedback being “like the Photoshop spectrum from cold to hot, blue to red.” while another
participant disagreed “No, you should think about the colours
in a rainbow, the blue is at the bottom and red at the top”.
When attempting to describe the auditory interface, the following participants discussed:
P1: When you listen to it, it sometimes sounds like the sound of your
engine in a car
P2: Yeah, I was thinking that as well, but mostly when it is low
P3: I think it sounds like it is accelerating and decelerating.
These real-world analogies also incorporated other data visualizations, for instance:
P9: So if a lot of hydrogen is hot then the hotter the colour the higher
the hydrogen
P10: But if you think about it, the colours on a thermometer go blue,

163

164

adapting the repertory grid technique

purple, pink and red
P11: What kind of thermometer do you own?
P9: We have one at home, we use it in the oven so it must be good to
stand that heat and its’ labels are coloured blue, purple, pink and red
so I’m guessing that this is the same.
Misunderstanding multimodal feedback: Although the haptic interface was designed to represent the information only
through vibration, the motors used in the interface also produced a sound that seemed to cause some confusion with the
participants. While the interface did incorporate two sensory
modalities (auditory and haptic) I do not consider it to be a
multimodal interface as the sounds were generated purely as a
consequence of the vibration motors and were not specifically
designed to represent the data. Notwithstanding, in this case I
observed that mixing two modalities within the one interface
caused confusion for practically all of the participants. This is
illustrated in the following exchanges:
P8: It sounds like it should feel stronger... it feels wrong that the sound
doesn’t match the vibration.
P7: But it is the vibration that is causing the sound, isn’t it?
P8: Yes, but I would feel better about it if loud sounds would have
strong vibrations.
This issue was further highlighted during another conversation between members of a different group:
P2: Would you rate that sensation pretty low?
P1: I would rate it as low
P2: I think it is hard to judge the vibration on its own because the
sound gets in your way.
One participant even went so far as to say: “If you didn’t
have the sound it would be an entirely different experience.” I
observed on one occasion that a one participant asked another
member of the group to put her hands over his ears so as to
block out the sounds being produced by the device. When this
was done he explained that the experience was completely different, stating:
P3: I am telling you when you block the sound out the vibration feels
like a lot more

6.3 the adaptation

P4: What do you mean, stronger?
P3: Yeah, stronger
P1: More intense?
P3: And that.
Visualizing non-visual modalities: When I examined the transcripts I observed that the participants conversed about ’imagining’ and ’visualizing’ while engaging with the haptic and auditory interface, but this was not the case with the visual interface. The following extract sums this up:
P8: I think it is harder to imagine another picture when you are looking at something
P11: What do you mean?
P8: Well, if you look at something you are seeing that thing so you
don’t really imagine looking at other things, but when you hear or
feel something you are more inclined to make a picture in your head,
aren’t you?
P12: I get you.
At no point, when engaging with the visual interface, did
any participant use visual references to help them better understand what was being represented. Yet on many occasions
when using the other interfaces, the participants used visual
analogies to further elaborate on what they heard and felt. While
feeling the vibrations from the haptic interface, one participant
asked another:
P4: Do you think that whatever we are feeling here can be seen out
there...
P2: I think I have seen picture it before, do you know the ones from
the Hubble telescope...
P3: I have one as my screensaver, is that what we are feeling? Cool!
P4: I didn’t think about that, I know them, there are some really cool
images of them, all the different colours, like nothing you have seen
before...so this is actually that, wow!
The use of visual analogies around the non-visual modalities
was also observed with the audio interface. On one occasion
when a group was discussing how the radio-telescope is static
and its movement was caused by the Earths’ rotation participant 4 remarked “You cant see the earth moving but if you
think about it you can kind of hear the slow rotation of the

165

166

adapting the repertory grid technique

earth, it’s weird, I wouldn’t of thought about that until she (P2)
said it and now its all I see”.
6.3.3.11

Discussion

The discussion that follows is divided into two parts. I first focus on issues related to the methodological adaptation of the
RepGrid approach, and then discuss issues that have arisen
through this work that might have implications for the future
design of data representations.
methodology To begin with, the blended approach utilizes a structured and methodologically validated approach within
a focus group session, thus extending the repertoire of focus
group techniques. Some commonly cited problems with focus
group studies include the need for a carefully trained researcher,
who must understand how to refocus conversations, and that
researchers have less control over the data produced than in
other quantitative studies or one-to-one interviewing [200]. I
believe that incorporating the structured approach of the RepGrid helps to keep the participants focused during the study
and does not require as much input from the researcher. The
RepGrid technique also helps to control the data gathered during the focus group session. With a traditional focus group
study, the data to be analysed is in the form of transcripts. This
can be extremely daunting for a novice or even a skilled researcher. However, in my proposed adaption, the RepGrid that
is produced provides the researcher with an ideal platform to
commence the analysis of the transcripts. I do appreciate that
the researcher must first learn to conduct and analyse a RepGrid study; despite of this I believe that the demands on the researchers during and after the study are significantly less than
that of a typical focus group study.
Moreover, the blended approach can also be interpreted as an
extension/adaptation of the RepGrid approach. I should first
clarify that the adaptation of the RedGrid technique I present
here is not meant as a replacement of the classical approach.
On the contrary, I still advocate the use of the classic approach
in certain circumstances. I do, however, believe that blending
the RepGrid technique with focus groups affords new opportunities for researchers to expose further insight, while also validating the elicited constructs and exposing new constructs that
may have been missed by the participants in the formal elic-

6.3 the adaptation

itation session. In the analysis of the discourse presented in
the previous sections, I cited an example of scrutinizing the
transcription for further meaning with respect to the constructs
(Stimulating-Non-Stimulating). Here we saw that the transcriptions exposed further meaning that would not be possible if
following the typical RepGrid approach.
I also used the example of examining the transcripts to better understand the construct (Sociable – Isolating). Here we
see that the transcripts revealed important information that
may not have being picked-up during a typical RepGrid study.
Apart from the fact that the nature of an individual interview
may not elicit constructs such as sociable or isolating, the discourse presented earlier revealed that the participants seemed
to ascribe this attribute to the interface and its environment,
and not to the representation modality. When designing the
modal interfaces to be used in the study I purposefully created interfaces that offered only single-user interaction. However, during the study I observed the participants soon found
ways of getting around the single-user interaction by squeezing more than two hands onto the haptic interface and using
their hands and sheets of paper to reflect the light from the
visual interface. Although on one occasion I observed participants attempting to share one headset, the predominant interaction with the audio interface was by one individual. I believe
that the transcripts may have exposed a fault in the design of
the interfaces and so we believe that this construct is in fact
not a valid attribute of the modalities. This may have been misconstrued if this construct had been elicited during a typical
RepGrid study.
The proposed blending of the methods also affords researchers
an opportunity to uncover constructs that were not explicitly
elicited during the study. In our analysis we presented the rationale for the inclusion of the construct (Harsh – Soothing)
in the final RepGrid. It is, however, important to ask why this
construct was not recorded during the group elicitation session.
Initially I assumed that the group would have mentioned it, but
may have felt that this construct was too similar to another i.e.
(Comfortable – Uncomfortable). However, after a thorough examination of the transcript, at no point did any participant use
either harsh or soothing when formalizing the constructs.

167

168

adapting the repertory grid technique

design Alongside exploring the potential of the blended approach to the RepGrid technique I also sought to expose design
relevant insight about the data representations when analysing
the data gathered during the studies. In the following I discuss
some of the key design relevant findings that emerged during
the blended approach.
Style over Function: In the analysis I presented a further
exploration of the constructs (Aesthetic – Practical). The discourse indicates that the participants demonstrated less trust
for the representation modality that they considered to be aesthetically pleasing, than those that they construed to be more
practical or utilitarian. This may led us to question whether it is
possible for a data representation to be beautiful and functional
at the same time. This is an on-going concern for disciplines
such as InfoVis, which is focused on balancing the communicative and aesthetic qualities of data representation.
Crossmodal Representation: I reported earlier that all groups
demonstrated a sense of confusion that seemed to be caused by
the mixing of modalities in the haptic interface. They perceived
the strength of the vibration not to be at the same intensity as
the sound it was emitting. It is clear from examining the transcripts that participant’s expectations were not met when they
placed their hands on the surface of the haptic interface. Although I do not classify the haptic interface as being one, this
may highlight an important concern for the design of crossmodal interfaces in general. Cross-modal interfaces differ from
multimodal ones in so far as they use more than one modality
to represent the same data. My analysis indicates that when using more than one modality to represent the same data, these
modalities must be of equal intensity, otherwise the user may
misinterpret or ignore the expected data insight, as one participant pointed out “...the sound doesn’t match the vibration.”
6.3.3.12

Summary of study

In this section I validated the blending of two methods (focus
group and RepGid) and compared it to a typical application
of the RepGrid technique. I conducted this while investigating
the role of modality in data representations. While maintaining
the integrity of a classic RepGrid study, I incorporated a focus
group session, which can be used to produce a multi-person

6.4 chapter summary

RepGrid that does not require the use of statistical measures
and analysis. I demonstrated how the discourse in the focus
group session, which surrounds the elicitation of the constructs
could be used as a resource to reveal further meaning, to validate the inclusion of constructs, and to reveal new constructs
that may have been missed by the participants during the formal elicitation session. I do however recognize some limitations
to the proposed adaption. Firstly, although I state that by integrating a focus group into a RepGrid study it makes the procedure more efficient, the time saved while carrying out the study
is easily lost when transcribing and analysing the obtained data.
I also acknowledge and appreciate that the data collected may
be more difficult to analyse than typical RepGrid data, which is
normally processed using software applications. Notwithstanding these limitations, to my knowledge, since the inception of
the RepGrid technique, no adaptation has been purported to
produce rich qualitative data during a group session. I believe
that the proposed blended approach has enough potential to
equip a designer or researcher who wishes to better understand
people’s experience of designed artefacts while also revealing
rich design relevant information.
6.4

chapter summary

In this chapter, I introduced the Repertory Grid Technique as
a useful method for collecting data on how people construe
their experience of objects, people or events. While this method
has been used by the HCI research community since the early
1980’s, recently there has been a resurgence of interest in the
technique. There are, however, some limitations with the traditional application of the technique, especially when following a phenomenological approach (as is my case). The main
issues relate to the type of data that is gathered and the time
and effort required to collect this data. To overcome these issues I presented a new approach to a RepGrid study, which
involved blending it with a focus group session and analysing
the data using quantitative methods. I formulated this adaptation to allow me to gather rich accounts of people’s experience of representational modality. The results of this study
showed clear differences between how people experienced the
visual modality compared to the other two (haptic and auditory). The study also shed light on the nuances of experiencing
representational modality, including the type of language used

169

170

adapting the repertory grid technique

around is affected by the representational modality in use, certain modalities (visual) seem to inspire discussion about the
causation, while others (haptic and auditory) relate to the affect of the data source, and certain modalities (haptic) seem to
evoke more emotional responses than others (visual).
The final study presented in this chapter was conducted to
valid and confirm the adaptation I tested in the first study. To
accomplish this I conducted two side-by-side studies that investigated the same elements but one followed the typical RepGrid
procedure, while the other utilise the blended approach. While
aim of this study was also to investigate the affect of representational modality on data experience; its primary purpose was
to compare the approaches (traditional verses blended). The results of this study indicate that, while the RepGrid’s produced
by each study are relatively similar, the blended approach is
more efficient, less demanding and provides rich data (transcripts of sessions), which can be used to shed further light on
the meaning of these constructs and to establish new constructs
that may have been missed during the construct elicitation session.
This chapter has not only provided a first glimpse of my exploration into people’s experience of representational modality,
it has also laid down the foundation of my methodological approach. I the next chapter I will add another layer to this by introducing another method, before combining these approaches
in Chapter 8 as I seek to establish a phenomenology of human
data relations.

FROM PHENOMENOLOGY TO
PSYCHO-PHENOMENOLOGY

If introspection is indeed a perception in the evocation of a past lived
experience, then like any perception its fecundity and effectiveness
will be commensurate with the categories which guide this perceptive
activity.

introduction

In this chapter I introduce the Elicitation Interview technique
as a method for gathering detailed and precise accounts of human experience. I argue that it can be applied in the context
data perception to help understand how people experience and
interpret representations as part of exploration and data analysis processes. In contrast to other qualitative methods the Elicitation Interview technique encourages participants to re-enact
their experience while minimizing post-reasoning. This chapter describes the key characteristics of this interview technique
and exemplifies how it can be applied to evaluate static data
representations. This study illustrates what types of insights
this technique can bring to the fore, for example, evidence for
deep interpretation of visual representations, and the formation of interpretations and stories beyond the represented data.
I discuss general evaluation scenarios where the Elicitation Interview technique may be beneficial and specify what needs to

171

172

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

be considered when applying this technique1 .
I begin this chapter by introducing the Elicitation Interview
technique, which was originally designed by the psychologist
Pierre Vermersch in an educational context. The Elicitation Interview is a retrospective interview technique, which was developed, in the phenomenological tradition known as psychophenomenology. Psycho phenomenological was conceived as a
response to a perceived need for a more methodical approach
to eliciting personal accounts of lived experience [294]. It focuses directly on practical ways of investigating experience through
the act of reflection. Proposed as both an instrument of research as well as an approach to discovery, it is a non-inductive
approach that elicits information through an in-depth interview about the experience at increased levels of “granularity”.
To accomplish this, the person being interviewed is guided
back towards the re-enactment or re-living of the experience
under investigation in order for them to provide an account,
not only about the conscious acts that the interviewee is aware
of but also those actions or cognitive processes that occur subconsciously. For instance, when driving a car you are completely
focused on the road ahead of you but maybe not on your body
position, which may be tense and uncomfortable. Known as prereflective consciousness, this aspect of experience is concealed
by the absorption of attention in the objective or content of the
experience (e.g. driving a car), and, as a result, is not instinctively described by people when recalling a past event. This
human phenomenon is particularly evident when we engage
in cognitive processes such as reading, writing, observing, listening, or analysing data, as we make use of processes that are
precise, but which largely elude our consciousness [221].

1 Much of the content of this chapter has recently been described in [102]. In
this article, co-authored by Dr. Uta Hinrichs and Prof. Dr. Eva Hornecker,
we explored the potential of the technique in the context of InfoVis. In this
chapter I extend this research to encompass a broader area of enquiry, including HCI. I wish to note that while this work was a collaboration, the
input from the other researchers only related to incorporating an InfoVis
perspective on the literature review (Dr. Hinrichs) and overseeing the findings of the study (Dr. Hinrichs and Prof. Hornecker). I contributed all other
aspects of the study on my own, including learning the technique, conducting the literature review, designing the study, conducting the interviews and
analysing the data.

7.1 introduction

To gain access to these concealed cognitive processes Vermersch suggested we guide the subject back to the experience
through the practise of introspection [298], which is not so
much a question of memory as it is a process of becoming
aware of the pre-reflective dimension of the past [299]. The
practise of guided introspection is a fundamental component of
psycho-phenomenology as it allows researchers to “obtain descriptive verbalisations based on acts of introspection relating
to a past lived experience” [299, p.22]. This is achieved through
a particular style of interviewing (the Elicitation Interview technique), which includes questions about the (physical) context
in which the experience took place and sensory aspects that accompanied it, the use of present tense during the interview to
help the participant “re-enact” the experience, and encouraging
detailed accounts of particular experiences through iterative
questioning. The technique was specifically designed to capture
rich and accurate accounts of people’s experiences while minimizing biases introduced through post-rationalization [294].
The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate how the Elicitation Interview technique can a valuable addition to current
evaluation techniques used to explore people’s experience of
data. Thus, I will present a study that reveals the techniques
potential to capture subjective experiences with data representations. The findings show that the Elicitation Interview brings
to the fore people’s interpretations of individual representation
aspects, and how they arrive at these interpretations by actively
seeking for personal connections, rich meaning, and stories.
This questions previous assumptions which claim that overor miss-interpretation of data representations can be avoided
through design [11]. While the Elicitation Interview does not
provide direct design considerations, it can help to unearth
problems or strengths of a design and point towards potential
solutions. The key aspects that I address in this chapter are:
• An introduction and description of the Elicitation Interview
technique in the context of exploring people’s experience of data.
• A study that exemplifies how the Elicitation Interview technique can be applied and what types of findings can be derived
from it.
• Practical considerations of how to apply this technique to evaluate data representations.

173

174

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

• A discussion of how the technique can be applied to different
evaluation scenarios and future research questions it brings to
the fore.
I wish to note that I do not propose the Elicitation Interview
technique as a replacement of the existing methods described
in Chapter 3. In many cases, depending on the research context,
different techniques or a mixed-method approach is appropriate. However, if the objective is to gather rich accounts of experience that correspond to the actual lived experience, about the
process of analysis and discovery, the Elicitation Interview can
be a useful tool that allows researchers to gain access to the people’s subjective experiences beyond their attitudes, judgements,
and observations.

7.2

background

Before I introduce the Elicitation interview technique, let me
digress for a moment to discuss my motivation for using it and
the preparation I followed to learn how to apply the technique.
I was first introduced to the Elicitation Interview technique in
the first months of my PhD. In the summer of 2011, I read Ann
Light’s paper “Transports of delight? What the experience of
receiving (mobile) phone calls can tell us about design” [162].
This research used the Elicitation Interview technique (or the
Explicitation technique, as it was known then) to form a detailed phenomenological account of people’s experience of receiving telephone calls and draws on the concepts of Martin
Heidegger, Andrew Feenberg, Don Ihde and Herbert Dreyfus.
Reading this paper opened my eyes to a methodology that I envisaged would allow me to capture first-hand accounts of people’s experience of data, which, in turn, may expose nuances
that are difficult to reveal when using other commonly used
methods, such as unstructured interviews or the think aloud
protocol.
Shortly after reading this paper I carried out a review of all
available literature on the technique, with the primary aim of
learning how to use it. I soon discovered that most of the original material was only available in French (cf. [294][295][296][297]
and there was little published in the English language. At this

7.3 the elicitation interview technique

point I contacted Ann Light (author of Transports of delight?
[162] to request further information on the technique. She informed me on the complex nature of the procedure and advised
that I participate in a formal training programme before using
it. However, she also told me that these training programmes
were presently only offered in French. Two years later, in July
2013, I finally managed to enrol in a weeklong training programme in Paris, which was delivered in English by Prof. Dr.
Claire Petitmengin (a onetime student of Pierre Vermersch) and
one of the key proponents of the technique2 . This training session was attended by fifteen participants, from eleven different
countries, with a variety of backgrounds, including: psychotherapists, psychologists, sociologists, a meditation instructor, a social worker, a medical doctor and a textile design researcher.
As part of this training we were taught about the history of the
technique and the theory that underpins it. Prof. Petitmengin
also provided us with practical guidance on how to conduct an
Elicitation interview. Following the training session, and over
a period of one-year, I conducted nearly one hundred practise interviews with colleagues, friends, family and students,
before returning to Paris in 2014 to participate in another training session that was focused on analysing Elicitation interview
data. In my experience, learning the procedure of the technique
was invaluable, however, once I began to carry out formal interviews, the process of practising the technique (over and over
again) proved to be vitally important. In the following sections
I introduce the Elicitation interview technique, the knowledge
I present here was gained through a combination of a comprehensive literature review, alongside Prof. Petitmengin’s training
sessions and the countless hours of conducting practise interviews.

7.3

the elicitation interview technique

The Elicitation Interview technique3 is a form of retrospective
interviewing that focuses on a particular experience (e.g., the
experience of a data representation). In contrast to other interview techniques, it is based on iterative questioning where
the participant is encouraged to describe their experience re2 see http://www.microphenomenology.com for more information on Prof. Dr.
Claire Petitmengin and the Elicitation Interview technique

175

176

peatedly at finer levels of granularity. First conceived by Pierre
Vermersch in the 1990’s [294], the technique was initially used
to help expert practitioners become aware of and describe the
implicit part of their skills, and also to help people to work
around cognitive blocks that may have impacted on their education. Since then the method has been used is a range of
contexts, including pedagogy (cf. [175], management (cf. [239],
medicine (cf. [222], therapy (cf. [132] and HCI (cf. [162]. Petitmengin have also used the technique to study intuitive experiences [220] and to investigate the structure of the auditory
experience [223]. In the context of HCI the Elicitation Interview
has been applied by Light and Wakeman [161] who used it to
explore people’s experience of entering text into a web interface,
and, more recently, Obrist and colleagues captured accounts of
people’s verbalizations of a tactile experiences by conducting a
series of elicitation interviews [209]. Although these examples
are situated across a diverse range of disciplines, they all share
a similar motivation: to elicit increasingly precise and detailed
information about people’s lived experience, whether this experience involves tactile perception, pedagogical tasks, listening
to sounds, a moment of intuition, or interaction with technology.
In Chapter 3, I discussed commonly used evaluation techniques to investigate how people form insight and make discoveries, these included observation, diaries, questionnaires, the
think-aloud protocol, and interviews. I also presented the rationale for employing these techniques and I eluded to the limitations of each. I argue that the Elicitation Interview technique
can overcome some of these limitations by helping researchers
to gain in-depth insights into people’s approaches, processes,
and subjective experiences of data analysis and interpretation
of data representations while minimizing the problem of postrationalization.
As the name suggests, the Elicitation Interview technique is a
special form of interview. In the context of HCI, interviews are a
common technique to gather opinions of participants after they
have interacted with a system or to learn about existing work
strategies to inform the design of a system. The data acquired
during an interview can be rich in insights, going beyond potential pre-assumptions of the interviewer and superficial opinions
of the participant. However, while interviews are frequently em-

7.3 the elicitation interview technique

ployed when evaluating systems, I found that the type and interview approach are rarely specified - researchers rarely explain how exactly the interview was conducted, beyond stating
its duration and, sometimes, its “structured”, “semi-structured”,
or “open-ended” character. Furthermore, when participants are
recalling past events in an interview there is a risk that post-hoc
rationalisation introduces details into the account that did not
occur during the original experience. To counteract this, interviews can be conducted in combination with video recordings
of participants’ interactions [236]. Video-recall can increase the
accuracy of the described experience while also reminding the
interviewee of details that would have otherwise been forgotten. However, watching the event unfold on video can stimulate
new thoughts that were not evident during the original experience. The Elicitation Interview technique differs from interview
methods commonly applied in HCI by guiding the participant
into a mental state where they come close to what they were actually thinking and feeling in-the-moment when they explored
the system for the first time.

7.3.1

Key Characteristics and Interview Phases

Through my review of existing published literature on the Elicitation Interview technique [162] [161] [175] [209] [223] [220] and
through my practical experience of using the technique, I have
identified a number of characteristics of this technique that are
important to consider when applying it.
An important issue to consider before using the Elicitation Interview technique is the type of experience to be investigated. It
is essential that this is a singular lived experience. For instance,
the technique can be used to help people describe their experience of a system or product situated precisely in space and
time. However, the technique is less useful when trying to elicit
a description of people’s experience of systems or products in
general as they tend to move away from describing the lived
experience towards the expression of comments, justifications,
explanations and beliefs.
Once the researcher has chosen a singular experience, the
mode of questioning used throughout the interview is noninductive and directive. Non-inductive, because the researcher/in-

177

178

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

terviewer does not suggest any content, but asks “content-empty”
questions such as: “when you do this, what do you do exactly?”.
This type of questioning enables the researcher to obtain precise
descriptions without imposing their own presuppositions [224].
The Elicitation Interview is also directive, i.e., throughout the
interview the researcher firmly maintains the participant’s attention on a singular experience, and guides the exploration of
these characteristics, down to the depth required [221].
Another important characteristic of the Elicitation interview
is that it is based on an iterative approach, where key experiences identified in previous iterations are pursued in more
depth in the next interview iteration. This stands in contrast to
common interview techniques, which typically follow a linear
flow of questions. Last but not least, the way the experience accounts are gathered during an Elicitation Interview aims at minimizing judgements or retrospective rationalization on the part
of the participant. Asking questions starting with why encourages judgemental conditions and can change the mood of the interview. If a reason for an answer is needed, then questions for
the how and what can help to clarify statements while not interrupting the recollection process or implying that a judgement
is required from the participant. This is illustrated in the following extract, where the participant is being guided to speak
about the moment when they finished reading the data visualization. Note that they are not being asked why they finished
but rather how they knew that they were finished:
Interviewer: Could I just ask you finally: how do you know when
you have ended? How do you know that you have completed?
Participant: Before I closed it down and I went on to something else,
I felt that if somebody was to ask me about the graph that the graph
told a bit of a story and it is a story that I would try to retell.
The Elicitation technique follows a number of phases that are
conducted in order. Some of these steps are revisited iteratively
to elicit more details on certain experiences mentioned by the
participant. Based on a literature review as well as my own
experience of conducting Elicitation interviews, I derived a diagram that illustrates these phases (see Figure 36). I describe the
key phases of the Elicitation Interview in detail in the following
paragraphs.

7.3 the elicitation interview technique

Figure 36: The phases of an Elicitation Interview typically follow in
order but may require iterations between phase 3, 4, and 5.
There may also be occasions when the interviewer needs
to reaffirm the original contract of agreement with the interviewee.

179

7.3.1.1

Agreement about Nature of Interview

As it is common with studies and interviews in general, it is important that an agreement is established between the researcher
and participant about the nature and format of the study before it starts. For an Elicitation Interview, this agreement differs
from typical consent forms, in that the agreement makes the
participant aware of the iterative nature of the interview that involves repeated and in-depth dwelling on certain experiences.
To address this, the in-depth and iterative nature of the interview should be explained to the participant, and they should
be made aware that they may withdraw from the interview at
any stage if they are not fully comfortable with the nature of
the interview. It may also be necessary, at certain points during
the interview, for the researcher to re-iterate this agreement by
requesting permission from the participant to probe a certain
issue, for instance: “If it is ok with you, I would like to return to the
point when you first became aware of X. Could you tell me how you
felt at this time.” Overall, questions and iterations should be performed in a gentle fashion that takes into account the probing
nature of the interview.
7.3.1.2 Induction of the Evocation State
The goal of an Elicitation Interview is to collect a detailed account that describes the unfolding of an experience, while allowing the researcher to elicit further details about moments
during this experience. To do this, the researcher guides the
participant toward a state of introspection, which facilitates the
(mental) re-enactment of the episode under investigation (e.g.,
a situation where the participant encountered a data visualization). This state is typically achieved by the researcher asking
the participant to see, hear, and feel whatever was happening
at the time of the original event or activity. The participant is
encouraged to retrieve the episode as if it was happening now.
The following example illustrates the process of guiding the
participant back to the event by stimulating various sensory
channels:
Interviewer: Can we go back to that moment when you read the data
visualization..., so when was this?
Participant: Ah... quarter past 7 this morning.
Interviewer: Ok and where are you?
Participant: At work.

7.3 the elicitation interview technique

Interviewer: At work ok, so are you at a desk?
Participant: I was at my desk, yeah.
Interviewer: Ok, and when you are at your desk, are you sitting or
standing?
Participant: Sitting...
Interviewer: Are you sitting upright?
Participant: Yeah...
Interviewer: So are you very straight, is your back very straight
or...?
Participant: It could be that I am leaning forward on the desk or I
am sitting up right. [bends forward and back in the chair]
Interviewer: And are your hands on the table or are they on your
body?
Participant: No, I kind of think that I have the feeling that I am leaning forward, more leaning onto my hands.
Interviewer: So you are leaning on your hands?
Participant: Yeah, underneath my chin. [mimics the pose she was in]
Interviewer: Ok, and you have the computer screen in front of you...
Is there anything else on the desk besides the computer screen?
Participant: [long pause] Yeah, I have my keyboard, I have my drink
bottle, I have my coffee.
Interviewer: Where is your coffee, on the left, or...?
Participant: On the left...
Interviewer: And is it strong coffee?
Participant: Yes, strong and freshly made.
Interviewer: Can you smell it, now?
Participant: Yes very much so...
The purpose of using such evocative language is to guide the
participant into a state of mind, coined by Vermersch as a state
of evocation [298]. A state of evocation is recognizable by common cues familiar to most of us, for instance: when someone is
recounting a past event to others, their gaze may drift off into
empty space and glaze over. Alongside these non-verbal clues,
there are also para-verbal clues that indicate whether a person
is in a state of evocation or not, for example, the slowing of
word flow and long pauses in the speech. There are also certain
verbal cues that the interviewer can check for; paramount is the
transition from the past to present tense. This is illustrated in
the excerpt above, when the participant is asked about the contents of her desk. After a long pause she replies in the present
tense: “I have my keyboard, I have my drink bottle, I have my coffee.”

181

182

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

Verbal cues on their own may not confirm that a state of
evocation has been reached. The researcher therefore has to be
attentive to the participant demonstrating a combination of verbal, non-verbal, and para-verbal cues. To help reach this state
it is advised that the participant sits in front of the researcher
but slightly to the left or right. This enables them to stare into
empty space without being obscured by the researcher.
To maintain a state of evocation in the participant throughout
the interview, it helps to conduct the interview in the present
tense. For instance, instead of asking the participant to recount
their memory of the event, which may result in them replying
in past tense: “I did this...I did that...”, the participant is invited
to re-experience a situation as if they were there, for instance,
by starting the interview with: “You are in front of your computer,
please tell me what you are seeing now.” This encourages the participant to be in-the-moment and to recall the experience as it
was lived by them at that particular moment. In a state of evocation a participant can mentally re-enact the past experience to
the point where this experience becomes highly prominent and
present for them, and the experience of being interviewed fades
into background [299]. The ability of the researcher to attain
and maintain a state of evocation in the participant is crucial
to the success of the interview. When the researcher recognizes
that the participant is emerging from a state of evocation, the
description of the experience can be reformulated, along with
certain sensory details that may be revealed during the interview, in order to refresh the evocation of the past situation.
At the beginning of an Elicitation Interview, the participant
is asked to think about a specific situation, in this case, a data
visualization that they have encountered. It is this experience
that forms the basis of the interview. Typically, the participant
is then guided to reveal the diachronic dimension of the experience, that is, how the experience unfolded over time. For
example, a participant may be asked questions such as: “What
is the first thing you do when you start reading the visualization?”,
“What happens next?”. The coloured blocks on the horizontal axis
shown in Figure 37 illustrate the diachronic dimension of an experience where each blocks represents an individual episode of
this experience. Note that such episodes differ in length and
may also overlap with each other.

7.3 the elicitation interview technique

After the first description of the experience, which focuses on
its diachronic (temporal) dimension, the participant is guided
to reveal the synchronic structure, that is, the detailed characteristics and key aspects of the experience, which is made up of
specific moments or episodes (see Figure 37). In this phase, the
iterative nature of the interview comes into play: the participant
is encouraged to repeatedly describe selected episodes of their
experience at different levels of detail. In each iteration the granularity of these descriptions are refined. This phase involves
questions such as: “You already mentioned that you have done X,
how do you do X?” This iterative process of asking the participant to go back to specific moments and to reveal increasingly
finer details about the experience is one of the unique characteristics of the Elicitation Interview technique, and it is what
facilitates the capturing of rich accounts of experience that can
then be analysed further.

Figure 37: The iterative nature of the Elicitation Interview. The
coloured blocks represent instances of a particular experience as they evolve over time (horizontal axis, diachronic
dimension). These instances are re-visited during the Elicitation Interview to reveal their nature in more detail (synchronic dimension). The height of each block indicates how
often an experience instance was re-visited.

Figure 36 illustrates the iterative nature of the Elicitation Interview through the height of blocks that depict the level of

183

184

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

detail to which a certain experience episode is explored. Each
transparent block of the same colour represent different interview iterations/levels of depth on an individual experience
episode. The researcher may come back to certain episodes several times, focusing on the entire episodes or particular subepisodes.

7.3.1.3

Data Collection and Analysis

Provided that the participant grants permission, it is recommended to both audio- and video-record the interview. Audio
recordings are essential for a detailed transcription and analysis of the participant’s statements. While video recordings are
valuable to capture non-verbal and para-verbal cues, which can
be an indicator of a participant reaching a state of evocation as
described above, or bodily gestures that are used in the experience recollection.
7.3.1.4

Reduction to Records of Pure Experience

No matter which method is chosen for the analysis of data gathered from Elicitation Interviews, the analysis should always begin with reducing the transcripts down to records of pure experience. This is done by removing all retrospective comments,
judgements and explanations by the participant. This process
is illustrated in the following extract when the participant is
asked to recall a moment of insight that he spoke about earlier in the interview. Note that the text in bold will be removed
from the final transcript as the participant is clearly applying
judgement, also you will see in this extract that the participant
momentarily emerges from a state of evocation while making
this judgement as he begins to stare directly at the research before returning his gaze into empty space.
Interviewer: You mentioned already about a particular time when
you had that light-bulb or ‘ah ha’ moment?
Participant: Yea.
Interviewer: and is there a sound associated with it, can you hear
someone saying ‘ah ha’?
Participant: yea in my head, (starting into space) I have some sort
of, it’s not that loud...but it would happen in my head, it would say
‘ah ha’ or ‘there it is’... (Stares directly at researcher) I think this is
the same sound I hear every time I get something right or like

7.3 the elicitation interview technique

that... (Gazes into space again) I feel some sort of confirmation in my
head when I realize that that is where the trend is...”
I provide further details on the process of reduction later
when I present the analysis of the data gathered during the
study. Finally, once the transcripts have been reduced to pure
experience they are sorted into the order in which the experience originally happened to help to identify how the experience
unfolded over time (diachronic structure).
7.3.1.5

Analysis Methods

The method of analysing the gathered data depends on the
focus of the research question. Qualitative analysis methods
such as Content Analysis [145], Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis [266], and Grounded Theory [78] lend themselves
well to the examination of data collected during an Elicitation
Interview. Due to the richness of the collected accounts, Discourse Analysis [232] has been used widely in HCI to analyse
Elicitation Interviews [162] [161] [209]. However, it is primarily concerned with scrutinizing the verbal dialogue gathered
during an interview and does not address the non-verbal or
para-verbal cues, which are important aspects of a participant’s
response during an Elicitation Interview.
In the Elicitation studies I present in this thesis, the method of
analysis I use is based on Thematic Analysis–the same method
I used in Chapter 5 to analyse a collection of multisensory
data representations. The approach I use here involves a set
of procedures designed to identify, examine, and report patterns (themes) that emerge from the interview transcripts. This
method complements the non-inductive approach of the Elicitation Interview technique. Also, Thematic Analysis has a similar
aim to phenomenology, in that it seeks to describe and understand the meanings that people give to their lived experiences
and can help to identify patterns across qualitative data.
In the following section I describe the study I conducted to
exemplify how the Elicitation Interview technique can be applied in the context investigating people’s experience of data
representation and what types of insights it can help reveal.

185

186

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

7.4

the elicitation study

The study described in this chapter was primarily conducted to
illustrate how the Elicitation Interview technique can be used
to gather accounts of people’s experience with static data visualizations, and to highlight the type of insight it can provide
about people’s interpretation of data, how these experiences unfolded over time (diachronic structure) and how key moments
manifest themselves as part of the exploration of the data representation (synchronic structure). In this example study, I sought
to mainly explore (1) how people interpret a data representation, and
what thought processes are in place from the time they begin to (visually) explore it until they feel that they are finished, and (2) if there
any similarities in the way that people describe their experience with
exploring these data visualizations.
To answer these questions I asked participants to interpret
a data visualization and interviewed them about their experience using the Elicitation Interview technique. Participants
were able to choose a visualization, from a collection of 18 that
I made available one week before the interview was conducted
(see three examples in Figure 38 and the full list is presented
in Appendix A). All the visualizations included in the collection were from rebuttable sources, such as Governmental bodies, and contained topics that are relevant to a broad cross section of society. Examples include a line graph chart showing
unemployment rates across the EU and in Ireland in particular
(see Figure 38, A), the numbers and age distribution of emigrants coming to Ireland from 1987–2012 (see Figure 38, B), or
the economic status of women in Ireland in 2011 (see Figure 38,
C).
As this was the first time I used the technique in a formal
study and the purpose of the was to explore and exemplify how
the Elicitation Interview can be applied in the context of exploring people’s experience of data representation, I choose to focus
on static data visualization. Including interactivity adds a further layer of complexity that may obscure the discovery about
interpretation. I do, however, acknowledge the importance of
interactivity in the experience of dynamic data representations,
and I explore this aspect in Chapter 8.

7.4.1

Participants and Procedure

Ten participants (four females) between 22 and 62 years (mean
36.7, SD 12.5) took part in the study. Participants had diverse
professional backgrounds, including a business analyst, a solicitor, a retired accountant, a designer, a teacher, a web developer,
a HCI researcher, a media producer, and two postgraduate media students.
Participants were first allowed to select one visualization and
then given one week to look at and try to understand/analyse/interpret it until they felt that they had gathered as much information from it as they could. Following this, the interviews
were conducted in a quiet location that was agreed upon between myself and the participant in the days leading up to the
interview, such as, in the office space normally occupied by the
participant.
I conducted all the interviews which followed the procedure
described above (see Figure 36). Each interview commenced
with an explanation of the purpose of the research and outlining the terms of the interview. The participants were then asked
a series of questions that were aimed at guiding them back to
the place and time when they first read the visualization. This
included questions such as: “When did you first read the visualization? Where were you at the time?” The line of questioning then
progressed to more sensory questions that encouraged participants to describe in detail their immediate environment when
they originally read the visualization. This included questions
such as: “Are there any sounds in the room?” or “Please describe
what else you see on your desk?”. As mentioned earlier, the pur-

187

188

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

pose of these types of questions is to guide the participant toward a state of evocation.
I then continued with questions that encouraged the participant to recall how the experience with the visualization unfolded (diachronic structure). During this phase I noted each
occasion where the participant described particularly interesting experience episodes, such as when moments of new insight
was discovered. Once the participant had recounted their experience in the order in which it originally occurred, I began to
ask the participant to return to these moments of interest and
to re-enact them in more detail, focusing on their thoughts and
feelings at the time (synchronic structure).
Each interview lasted just under a half an hour on average
and were video- and audio-recorded resulting in a total of just
under five hours of material for transcription. To allow for further immersion in the data, I also transcribed each interview.
Interview transcriptions also included gestures by the participant so that the non-verbal and para-verbal cues could be analysed alongside the verbal dialogue (see a full transcript of one
interview in Appendix B).
7.4.2

Data Analysis

The transcribed interview recordings formed the basis for my
data analysis that, as described earlier, followed the approach of
Thematic Analysis [23], (Guest et al., 2012). This approach follows five discrete phases: (1) familiarization, (2) thematic coding, (3) extracting themes, (4) reviewing themes, and (5) defining and naming themes.
familiarization This phase involved reading the transcripts
repeatedly to familiarize myself with the data even more. As
with many qualitative study approaches, this is an essential
phase of the data analysis as it allows the researcher to gain
an overview of the data, which later enables the identification
of thematic codes [14].
thematic coding I then derived an initial set of thematic
codes from the data. Thematic codes can be defined as parts
of the data relevant to the research questions and that capture
the qualitative richness of the phenomenon [23]. This process

7.4 the elicitation study

involves line-by-line open-coding. After careful coding of all
transcripts, I assigned 82 preliminary codes to 232 extracts. I
then passed this analysis to my colleagues (Prof. Hornecker and
Dr. Hinrichs) who validated these codes and minor adjustments
were applied before the list of codes was finalized.
extracting, reviewing and defining themes The final three phases of analysis involved the extraction, review,
and definition of themes that emerged from the thematic codes.
Themes are broader than thematic codes in that they capture
important details and meaningful patterns within the data in
relation to the research question, and they apply across transcripts [24]. For reasons of rigor, all three of us sorted these
codes into themes. I produced an initial set of themes, which
was then reviewed and refined the second researcher (Prof. Hornecker), who then passed it on to the third researcher (Dr. Hinrichs). A total of nine core themes emerged during this phase.
The final phase of the analysis involved defining and naming
these themes, this involved identifying the essence of what each
theme is about.
Table 11 shows these themes coupled with their definitions
and the codes to which each theme corresponds. I also include
illustrative quotes for each theme. The following sections describe some of these themes in more detail and illustrate the
types of insights that are enabled by this interview technique.
7.4.3

Capturing Experiences with Data Visualizations

The themes that emerged from our analysis, as summarized in
Table 11, provide examples of the types of insights that the Elicitation Interview technique can provide. These include a deep
interpretation of individual visual components of the representations (Table 11: Theme A), participants trying to connect the
data and topics represented in the visualization with events of
their personal lives (Table 11: Theme B), participants experiencing their exploration of the visualization as a dialogue with
the visualization itself and/or its creators (Table 11: Theme C),
and participants contemplating about the meaning of the visualizations and the data represented on a higher level (Table 11:
Theme D). In the following, I highlight four selected themes
that exemplify different types of experiences that can be cap-

analysis of the transcripts. The numbers in the themes column refer to the number of participants who the codes were
applied to.

7.4.3.1

Deep Interpretation of Visuals

The Elicitation Interviews led to numerous instances where participants commented on their interpretation of visual elements
utilized in the representations (e.g., shape or colour) (Table 11:
Theme A). At various stages of the interviews all participants
spoke about the importance of colour to form meaning from
the visualizations. In many cases it was the first visual variable
that they studied to make sense of the visualization. This is
illustrated in the following extract where the participant is recounting the first thing he did when reading the visualization:
“I look at the colours first, they are the first thing that catches my
eye... so after I look at the colours, I look at the colour code, what’s
that called again? The key, that explains what the colours mean. And
after that I looked at the plain text to figure out what it was all about
from then on.”, [JC, Appendix A1].
This process was also echoed by other participants. Interestingly one participants’ statement suggests that interpreting the
colours is a separate process from reading the visualization:
“The first thing I do is check the colours and lines before I start to
read what it is all about just to get at the information quickly. There
are some blue lines here and green ones here... [short pause, pointing

193

194

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

out in space] and then I start to read it.”, [VM, Appendix A5].
I also found participants interpreting visual elements such as
position and texture to help them making sense of the visualization. These attempts were sometimes successful, sometimes
not. For example, one participant used the path of a line to interpret any trends in the data:
“I look for, what would you call it, maybe anomalies or inconsistencies in the line movement, that stood out because they are not following a symmetric pattern.”, [JC, Appendix A3].
Another participant found the use of some visual elements
impeded her from understanding the underlying information:
“The first thing I notice while looking at the data visualization is
the confusing [appearance]. The kind of patterns of the data visualization so even before I even read the data itself I find the way that the
patterns fitted together in the circle, in the pie chart... it looks a bit
dizzy.”, [JS, Fig 7.3C].
These statements illustrate that the interpretation of visual
variables was often the first cognitive task they engaged in
when starting to read the visualizations. This raised curiosity
and led to initial insights, but was often also already connected
to an emotional experience (indicated by expressions such as
“confusing” and the feeling of “dizziness”, as highlighted in
the statement above). Interviews are typically utilized to explore the utility of the visualization and the effectiveness of
the use of particular variables to represent the data in focus statements similar to the above are therefore not unusual if we
ask people how they understand and interpret a visualization.
However, as I illustrate in the following paragraphs, the focus
of the Elicitation interview technique on in-the-moment experiences and its iterative character can also trigger rich perspectives on people’s experiences with simple data representations
that go beyond what we can gather from traditional interview
strategies.
7.4.3.2

Revealing a Process of Personal Contextualization

Six out of the ten participants revealed that they connected the
data visualization to personal situations in their lives (Table 11:
Theme B). This theme was derived from explicit references to

7.4 the elicitation study

personal circumstances in relation to the represented data. It
is important to highlight that I did not prompt participants
to comment on these personal perspectives, but these were revealed when I asked participants to go back to the situation in
which they read the visualization, and to talk about what they
thought and felt like at the time. For instance, participants used
their own circumstances combined with those of their family
or friends to contextualize aspects of the visualization. This is
illustrated in the following statement when the participant describes his process of interpreting the data visualization shown
in ( Figure 38, A):
“Between 2007 and 2008 it jumped, and that would have been when
I started college and then my father was out of work.”, [MMC, Figure 38, A].
Personal references were also used to help make sense of the
visualization and to verify that the presented topics were understood correctly:
“I start looking to make sure I understand the chart to think
about my own situation and people I know in my surroundings.”, [JS, Figure 38, C].
Another participant contemplated how the visualization applied to her own circumstances which prompted her to critically question the suitability of the data categories presented in
the visualization:
“When I am looking through it, it is putting women into different
classifications, and I was like: ‘Oh, where would I fall?’, and I see that
I fall basically into several of them so I was saying: ‘Do I actually fall
into none of them?”, [DH, Figure 38, C].
These examples not only show that participants used references to their personal life as part of their interpretation of
the visualizations, but also that this active seeking of a personal connection to the represented data was useful when (1)
reaffirming an understanding of the presented information, (2)
contextualizing the information, and (3) critically contemplate
about presented approaches and facts. I acknowledge that it
is not clear whether these aspects would have occurred if the
data visualization had little or no connection to participants’

195

196

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

personal situations and experiences. However, some participant
statements suggest that they would actively seek for personal
connections to the data to better understand the visualization,
even when the presented topic had little relevance to them personally. For example, one participant commented on a graph
that shows Ireland’s dependency on imported energy from 19902011:
“When I am seeing 2005, I am thinking ‘Where I was in 2005?’ or
I am thinking where I was working in that particular year or a particular film that might have been out in that year.”, [JC, Appendix A,
A3].
Reminiscing his circumstances in 2005 did not directly help
this participant to form meaning from the visualization, but it
is integral to his process of generating meaning and personal
relevance and to his general subjective experience of the visualization. Along these lines, one participant summarized:
“It is the things that are important to you that lets you connect with
the graph. You know, 2008 was a big year for me, but whoever created
the graph, 2008 may not have been so special. These things I see but
no one else sees; they let you contextualize that graph so they are ‘my
graph’ within their [the designer’s] graph.” [MMC, Figure 38, A].
7.4.3.3

Presence of a Dialogue with the Data

Reiterating on participant’s process of reading and interpreting
the visualizations, and on their experiences and emotional reactions as part of this process also revealed that participants
sometimes felt like engaging in a form of dialogue with the
data and/or with the creator(s) of the visualization (Table 11:
Theme C). The following extract illustrates such a dialogue:
“It just took a couple of minutes of trying to absorb what the
thing was saying and what the implications are for that personally.”,
[EC, Figure 38, B].
The expression “what the thing was saying” implies a form
of communication. Again, this statement also illustrates participants’ attempts to extract personal meaning from the visualization.

7.4 the elicitation study

I found some variations of this “Dialogue with Data” theme.
For instance, when talking about his experience with a bar
graph that represents the number of young people in Ireland
with a third-level education (see Appendix A, A1), one participant described engaging in a form of communication with the
data representation, but this time the visualization seemed to
be doing more than just saying; to him it appeared to try to
explain something:
“I noticed that there was some kind of trend which was increasing
over time, so I took that as being the information that it was trying to
explain to me.”, [CB Appendix A, A1].
Statements by another participant implied a more complex relationship to the data visualization. This participant described a
sense of mistrust in the data that was being represented. Noticing irregularities in the trend he extracted from the graph triggered this mistrust:
“I tried to look at it very critically then—is it telling me the truth
or is it not telling me the truth.”, [MMC, Figure 38, A].
Interestingly, this participant never mentioned a sense of mistrust toward the creators of the graph. Instead, he directed this
mistrust solely at the visualization itself.
Other participants referred to the creators of the graphs as
they were trying to make sense of the data representation:
“I think, I knew what they were trying to tell me. The other stuff, I
had to filter out, the age thing and the pink.”, [VF, Appendix A, A4].
While there were aspects in the graph that did not make
sense to her, she tried to extract the basic story, which she
thought was intended by the designers of the graph.

7.4.3.4

Finding Meaning Beyond the Data

As described earlier, participants often referred to seeking personal connections within the data representations (Table 11:
Theme B). I found that these personal connections sometimes
resulted in rich interpretations that went beyond the data that
was actually being presented in the visualizations (Table 11:

197

198

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

Theme D). This is illustrated in participants talking about the
implications of the represented data:
“I thought of what is happening behind the graph, you know, how
many people does this affect? Like, when Ireland is at 12%... Who are
those 12%? To me this is just a figure, but to them this is their livelihood. That it is not just a graph; there is a lot more going on behind
it.”, [MMC, Figure 38, A].
Another participant echoes this emotive response when he
was talking about his experience while reading the graph shown
in (Figure 38, B) :
“When I saw the trend, and I understood what it is saying... Suddenly, then, there is a phase when I am looking at the information
and the information means something more than just a graph.”, [EC,
Figure 38, B].
This participant expanded on this point further by explaining
what he took from the graph, and how he will communicate the
meaning that he formed to others:
“I am surprised at the fact that there were people actually emigrating from the country in much greater numbers than I thought, so that
is what I am left with now, rather than the memory of the figures
[numbers]... I felt that if somebody was to ask me about the graph,
that the graph told a bit of a story and it is a story that I would try to
retell.”, [EC, Figure 38, B].
For some participants, this revelation of meaning beyond the
data manifested itself in vivid pictures. One participant described literally seeing old people and families boarding aeroplanes in front of his “inner eye” while he was reading a bar
graph representing the rate of emigration from Ireland (see Figure 38, B). Another participant described seeing a clear moving
image of a woman working in the kitchen that manifested in
her head while she was reading a pie chart representing the economic status of Irish women in 2011 (see Figure 38, C). These
examples illustrate that even plain graphs and charts, intended
or not, communicate rich stories that are triggered and influenced by the personal background, experiences, and attitudes
that the person interpreting the visualizations brings into the

7.5 discussion

analysis process.
The themes and statements described above illustrate the variety and depth of some personal experiences and interpretation processes of the provided data representations that I was
able to gather through relatively brief (30 min.) Elicitation interviews. Again, I did not prompt participants to interpret their
reading activity of the data visualizations in this personal way,
but these aspects naturally came up when participants were
prompted to “re-enact” the situation in which they read the visualizations for the first time. Along these lines, this vignette
of findings shows how an Elicitation interview can bring to the
fore personal experiences as they evolve during the reading and
interpretation of a data visualization. While such findings may
not directly point toward implications for design, I believe they
shed light into how insights develop when reading a data representation.

7.5

discussion

In this section I critically discuss the Elicitation Interview as
technique for studying personal experiences and how this technique can be applied in different research areas. I also outline
the types of findings the technique can support in comparison
to other qualitative methods. I end with a discussion on the
practical considerations that need to be observed when using
the Elicitation Interview to gather precise accounts of experiences.
7.5.1

Insights about Design and Representation Aspects

Although the Elicitation Interview technique has been successfully applied to gather specific design recommendations for interface design [161], its strength lies in its ability to facilitate
the collection of data on how people think and feel while interacting with systems. In this way it can help investigate how
insight is generated and discoveries occur during this process.
A better understanding of how people experience systems on a
personal level can inform the design process at least indirectly.
The findings I present in this chapter, for instance, revealed that
colour is an important visual variable that participants usually
tried to actively decipher first. Remarks about visual variables

199

200

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

and marks were common (Table 11: Theme A). Furthermore,
the fact that some participants tried to take in the visualization
as a whole first, before starting to decipher its meaning and
focus on individual components shows that the overall impression of a visualization already influences people’s subsequent
interpretation and sense-making. Although I did not compare
the Elicitation technique with other methods, I argue that there
is evidence to show that these deep insights on the nuances of
data interpretation would be difficult to uncover using other
methods.
7.5.2

Revealing Deep Experiences and Interpretation Processes

In Chapter 3, I discussed the inherent difficulties in capturing episodes of experience. The evaluation methods most commonly used to capture these moments all have limitations, whether
it is the introduction of post-hoc rationalisation or personal biases or the difficulty in capturing people’s thought processes. I
argue that these limitations are reduced or not apparent at all
with the Elicitation technique and it offers researchers a tool
to generate deeper understanding of how people experience
and interpret systems and how insights and discoveries derive.
This does not only include what types of discoveries are made,
but also how people arrived at these, and how these insights
fit into and are influenced by people’s personal background
and previous experiences. For example, the study presented
here suggests that people actively construct personal connections while reading static data representations - even if these
do not necessarily aim at visually projecting or triggering certain emotions or contextual connotations (Table 11: Theme B
and Theme D). This finding, which would be difficult to identify through common interview techniques or other qualitative
research methods, suggests a new perspective on the debate
around the effects of visual embellishments in visualization design [11]: even a rather plainly designed visualization, such as
those used in this study, may trigger vivid connections and
imaginative thought processes that, in turn, may unfold to an
interpretation or message that goes beyond the depicted data.
7.5.3

Scenarios of Use

When illustrating the key characteristics of an Elicitation Interview I highlighted the type of experience as a fundamental el-

7.5 discussion

ement to the successful application of the technique, however,
deciding upon what singular experience to investigate depends
on the context and purpose of the study. The procedure I followed in the study involved creating an experience by providing the interviewees with a choice of visualizations to read before the interview took place. The reason I offered the participants this amount of time was mainly due to practical concerns,
as I wanted to be assured that they would have enough time to
read the visualizations. Other studies have shown that the technique can be also be applied successfully over a shorter period
of time, sometimes immediately before the interview [209]. An
Elicitation Interview can also be used to investigate an experience that was not seeded by the researcher. In this the technique
could be used to investigate moments such as when a system
or product had a significant impact on a person life, to study
and better understand the affect it had on people.
7.5.4

Understanding Environments and Work Practises

Studies that provide an understanding of people’s work practises or activities in non-work related scenarios are important to
estimate the (potential) role of systems in these contexts. They
can help the derivation of design considerations and requirements. However, it can be difficult for people to formulate and
describe processes that they engage in on an everyday basis.
Certain activities, for example, those that are performed frequently may seem trivial and remain unreported. The Elicitation Interview, with its focus on guiding participants into a
mental state where they re-enact certain experiences, can help
to gather details not only about the types of activities people
engage in, but also how these are conducted and how participants experience them.
7.5.5

Data Analysis and Presentation of Results

The analysis and presentation of findings gathered from an Elicitation Interview is similar to that of common qualitative methods such as interviews or video analysis. It is key to follow a
rigorous qualitative approach, and the involvement of multiple
coders in this process will help to verify themes that emerge
from the data. When it comes to presenting the results of an
Elicitation Interview, it is important to support and illustrate
the argument with direct quotes from participants. Quantita-

201

202

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

tive data in the form of, for example, the number of participants
who discussed a particular topic, can help to enhance results. If
ethical concerns allow this, the transcribed interview data can
be made publicly available to allow other researchers to better comprehend the presented results and conduct follow-up
studies. However, while the data collection and analysis process can be made as transparent as possible, it will be difficult
to fully reproduce an Elicitation Interview, as with all qualitative research methods the particular in-situ study context and
the in-the-moment connection between participant and the interviewer may bring some insights to the fore that will not come
up otherwise. This is in the nature of qualitative studies and can
be considered a limitation. However, it is such types of studies,
which enables rich and direct accounts of participants’ experiences that cannot be collected otherwise.
7.5.6

The Elicitation Interview in Comparison

The study I present in this chapter is the first to apply the
Elicitation Interview in the context of evaluating people’s experience of data representation and was primarily conducted
to explore the potential of this technique. Future studies will
have to investigate in more detail its strengths and limitations,
in particular in comparison to other qualitative evaluation techniques, such as think-aloud protocols, regular post-session interviews, or video-guided interviews. To this point I can only
speculate that the Elicitation Interview technique can be advantageous over think-aloud protocols as it does not interfere with
on-going thought processes during the activity in focus. Similarly, the themes we extracted from the Elicitation Interviews
illustrate people’s emotional reactions to data representations
that common post-session interviews are unlikely to capture. It
is the iterative character of the Elicitation Interview that enables
a focus on “in-the-moment” experiences that are grounded in
sensory aspects of the experience (e.g., smell, tactile, and auditory aspects) and, therefore, the collection of very personal
experience accounts, such as the seeking of personal connections to reaffirm and contextualize the represented data, the
experience of the data representation as a animated entity that
“explains” information but may not “tell the truth”, and the extraction of rich meaning and stories from charts and graphs,
that go beyond the represented data, and that even manifest
themselves in vivid pictures. It would be interesting to com-

7.5 discussion

pare the Elicitation Interview to video-guided interview techniques that confront the participant with visual accounts of
past activities or experiences. While I expect a higher risk of
post-rationalization with such techniques, future studies will
have to investigate these aspects in detail. While comparative
studies of evaluation methods have been suggested previously
(cf. [207], they are still rare.
7.5.7

Practical Considerations

The Elicitation Interview technique provides researchers with a
valuable tool to capture experience and offers unique insights
into cognitive processes involved. However, it should have become clear that special attention has to be paid to how the interview is conducted, and I have named a number of procedures
that need to be applied (agreement with participant, interview
in present tense, maintaining a state of evocation in the participant, see Figure 36). As well as the interview protocol, there
are other issues that need to be considered when conducting
an Elicitation interview, in the following I discuss each of these
individually.
training Like all qualitative evaluation techniques, the Elicitation Interview requires training and a certain level of practise
in order to apply it effectively. In particular, all interviewing
requires experience to minimize the introduction of potential
biases through leading questions [157]. Similarly, the nature of
focus groups requires carefully trained researchers, who understand, for example, how to engage all participants in a topic
and how to refocus conversations [200]. From a practise/training aspect, the Elicitation Interview is therefore not more time
or resource intensive than other qualitative research methods,
in some ways, it may be even be easier to gain practise. Much
like most other qualitative methods, the Elicitation Interview
technique rewards such efforts by producing a vast amount of
rich data, which, and this, again, is a downside of all qualitative research approaches, has to be processed as part of a time
consuming and, at times, qualitative analysis process.
context While I imagine the Elicitation Interview technique
to be valuable across the different research areas, including
HCI, CSCW, InfoVis, and Visual Analytics, it has to be considered that the technique may not be applicable in all situations

203

204

from phenomenology to psycho-phenomenology

contexts. For instance, the Elicitation Interview requires time
and is therefore not appropriate to gather feedback from people
in an ad-hoc manner. Also, the selection of participants has to
be carefully considered. Some people may feel uncomfortable
with the style in which the Elicitation Interview is conducted,
as it involves in-depth questions about emotional aspects of the
experience. In extreme cases, such an interview can trigger unexpected or strong emotions in participants, which may require
the discontinuation of the interview. For instance, during a prestudy I encountered a difficult situation where a participant
became extremely distressed when recounting her experience
of reading a visualization that evoked an emotional event in
her life. This potential for strong emotional reactions has to be
considered during the study design, in particular when recruiting participants. Also, participants have to be informed about
this as a potential risk of their participation.
physical setting The interview should take place in quiet
location to allow the interviewee to concentrate on re-enacting
the original experience. Although it is not a perquisite, it helps
the process of re-enactment to conduct the interview in the
same location as where the event or activity in focus took place.
As mentioned already, the position of the interviewee is also
an important criteria. To help the participant reach a state of
evocation they should be seated at an angle to the interviewer,
this allows them to gaze into space without looking straight at
the interviewer.
props Using the Elicitation Interview in pedagogical and
therapeutic contexts has shown that using props during the
interview may help to reach and maintain a state of evocation.
For instance, holding an object such as a childhood toy during
the interview may help a participant to re-enact a childhood
event. It is not clear, however, how this practice transfers to
other contexts. For example, providing the participant with the
actual item under investigation, in our case the data visualization itself, may introduce bias or rationalization on the part of
the interviewee. Future studies are required to investigate this
aspect further.
individual vs. group interviews To my knowledge the
Elicitation Interview technique has only ever been used with
individual participants; the in-depth and personal character of

7.6 chapter summary

the interview technique does not seem to lend itself to group
scenarios. However, in collaborative scenarios it could be interesting to explore experiences of group members individually
using the Elicitation Interview technique and compare these
findings with aspects that come out of regular interviews or
focus groups with all members together. This points to the potential of the Elicitation Interview technique to be combined
with other interview styles and evaluation methods, which, in
general, is an interesting area for future research.
7.6

chapter summary

In this chapter I introduced a psycho-phenomenological methodology known as the Elicitation Interview technique. This technique aims at capturing genuine accounts of people’s lived experiences, including hedonistic, emotional and sensory aspects
while minimizing potential biases through post-rationalization.
Key characteristics include guiding the participant into a state
of evocation, the capture of people’s experiences at different
levels of detail through iterative recall, and the use of present
tense to maintain a state of evocation in the participant. I also
presented a study that illustrates how the Elicitation Interview
technique can be applied in different contexts and through a
vignette of findings, I have shown what types of insights this
technique can support. For instance, the findings illustrate how
people seek for personal connections to the presented data to
reaffirm and contextualize the information that is gained, and
how these personal connections can also promote the critical
contemplation of the presented approaches and facts. Furthermore, I have collected examples of people engaging in a personal dialogue with data representations that, evidently, can
trigger rich emotions and interpretations that go beyond the
presented data.
This chapter provides a first glimpse into the potential of this
technique. In the next chapter I employ the technique again,
this time I use it alongside the RepGrid technique to capture different levels of experience with interactive tangible data driven
artefacts.

introduction

The purpose of this chapter is to build upon the theoretical,
methodological and design knowledge and empirical findings
presented in the preceding chapters. I sought to achieve this by
designing an experiment that would examine a series of interactive data representations by delving deep into the experience
people have with them. In Chapter 4, I showed how tangible
data representations are a natural, fun and engaging way to
represent scientific data for the general public. I followed this
in Chapter 6 by showing how adapting and applying the Repertory Grid technique allows for the capture of rich design relevant insight. Using this method allowed me to uncover how representational modality affects the way people experience data.
In Chapter 7, I introduced the Elicitation Interview technique
and discussed its potential for evaluating people’s experience
of data representations. Using this technique to investigate people’s experience with static data visualizations uncovered evidence for deep interpretation of visual representations, and the
formation of interpretations and stories beyond the represented
data. The aim now is to leverage the knowledge gained thus far
to inform the design and evaluation of a set of tangible data representations, which will be used by participant’s in their home
or work life.
This chapter is divided into three phases, a design phase and
two evaluation studies. The two studies I describe incorporate
different methodologies (the Repertory Grid technique and the
Elicitation interview technique), and were conducted consecutively. The overall rationale for employing this approach was to
conduct a series of experiments that allows for the elicitation of
accounts of experience at finer levels of granularity. I envisaged
this approach as being like a journey down through the strata

207

208

delving below the surface

of data experience, with each level unearthing more than the
previous, until I finally present holistic description of people’s
experience with tangible data representations. While I will discuss the findings of each of the studies separately, I conclude
this chapter by collating both findings.
The first phase of this study incorporates the design and implementation of a series of data-driven prototypes that measure and represent real-time indoor air quality through different modalities (visual, auditory and haptic) . The motivation
for creating these devices is twofold. First, the prototypes I
designed in earlier chapters were either produced for specific
public places (Chapter 4) or had limited functionality (Chapter 6). I now sought to create working prototypes that could
be deployed and used in everyday scenarios, such as at home
or work. I was also interested in exploring whether tangible
interaction; combined with different representational modalities, affect the way people perceive data. At the same time, I
wanted to provide people with a novel interface that makes
them aware of their immediate environment through data representation. To achieve this, the approach I took was to create,
what I term ’design probes’: three objects that possess similar
design features but differ in one aspect (here: representation
modality). In phase two, I investigate these design probes by
conducting a RepGrid study in form of a focus group session.
The aim here was to gather accounts of people’s immediate impression of using the prototypes and compare the differences
between the three probes. The final phase comprises of a study
that involves deploying the probes into the home and work life
of twelve people over a period of one week. Following this, I interviewed each participant about his or her experience with the
probes using the Elicitation interview technique. The purpose
of this interview was to get the participant to recall a memorable episode of using the prototype. I specifically sought to
focus on a moment where the participant became aware they
had generated insight from the representation, and by using
the elicitation technique I encouraged them to become aware of
and talk about the cognitive and physical processes they used
at the time of the original episode.

8.2 design approach

8.2

design approach

A Design Probe approach involves creating multiple versions
(in this case three) of a prototype that possess similar design
features but differ in one aspect (here: representation modality). Because the representational modality is the only variation
between the three prototypes, it allows me to focus the evaluation on drawing out comparisons without having other variables that may affect the findings of the study. The data source
that is represented by the prototypes was also an important aspect. In the experiments I presented in earlier chapters, the data
used was of little direct and immediate relevance to the participant’s and included environmental, financial, economic, social
and live data from deep space. For this study I sought to utilise
data that would be more personally meaningful for the participant. The data I choose was real-time ambient indoor air quality
(IAQ). Thus, I envisaged a series of prototypes that would provide people with a novel tool that heightens awareness of IAQ
and encourages them to take action, such as opening a window
to ventilate the space and improve their working or living environment without impacting on the energy consumption of the
building.
When seeking to maintain a healthy lifestyle and working
environment, an aspect we often overlook is the quality of the
air around us. It is a common misconception that the quality
of indoor air is higher than that of outdoor air. In fact, recent
studies have shown that indoor levels of pollutants are two to
five times higher than outdoor levels. This issue is exasperated
further by the necessity to spend the majority of our daily lives
indoors. One of the most important indicators of indoor air
quality (IAQ) is the level of Carbon dioxide CO2 in the ambient
environment.
8.2.1

Design Process

In the early stages of the design process I made a number of key
decisions which resulting in a design criteria for the prototypes.
First, the prototypes should be portable so they can be moved
within an environment and shared by people who occupy this
space. Also, I did not want the prototypes to be autonomous;
instead, they should require explicit user-interaction to request
the data, unlike people’s role with ambient or peripheral dis-

plays [265]. I made this decision as I was interested in focusing
the investigation on the specific moment people perceive the
data representation. Requiring people to interact with the device to display the representation allows me to focus on the
moment when people begin the process of data interpretation.
Finally, I designed the physical shape of the prototypes as a
cube that would fit comfortably into an adult hand and also so
that they could be placed safely on a flat surface. This shape
also offered us multiple surfaces to be exploited for user interaction.
A fundamental element of all data representations is the type
of modality used to represent data. For reasons of consistency
I choose to employ the same modalities used in the studies described in Chapter 6 – auditory, haptic, and visual. In the auditory display, I designed the data to be mapped to the frequency
of a computer-generated sound, while the same data is repre-

8.2 design approach

sented through vibrations for the haptic display. In the early
designs of the visual display I sought to use an equally abstract
representations format, such as, for instance, colour or position.
However, in the prototype I present here, I use a numericaldisplay, as I wanted to replicate the way IAQ is traditionally
represented (numerical: PPM). The choice of wood as material
for the cubes was influenced by the use of vibro–tactile feedback, since I found that natural materials evenly distribute vibrations better that synthetic materials, such as plastic. Finally,
one of the most critical design aspects was the style of userinteraction employed to trigger the device to measure and represent the IAQ. I envisaged the mode of user-interaction should
be natural, familiar and intuitive.
To assist the design of the interaction style I conducted an
exploratory design workshop to observe how people naturally
interacted with hand-held cubes. I invited 10 final year design
students to participate, asking them to interact and play with
the cubes in order to elicit a response from within the cube.
I fitted each of the cubes with a mini-speaker, which I could
remotely control. On occasions, when a participant interacted
with the device I would remotely activate a sonic tone to be
played through the speaker. This would signify to the user to
try another form of interaction. This session lasted 30 minutes
and was documented using video recording equipment. During the analysis of the tapes, I recorded numerous ways people
interacted with the cubes, which included, shaking, knocking,
spinning, flipping, dropping and sliding the cube onto a surface.
8.2.2

Implementation

Next, I produced three prototypes that require the user to shake
to trigger the representation of the real-time ambient IAQ levels. I implemented the shaking gesture not only because the
study showed it is a common gesture that appears familiar for
most people, but I also found that it allowed the CO2 sensor
to sample air from a larger area. The actuators used to display
the data are unique in each of the three prototypes. In the visual prototype (Figure 39, C) I incorporated a 4-digit, 7-segment
display to represent the value in raw numerical format. In the
haptic display (Figure 39, B) I used eight five-volt vibration motors fixed to the inside walls of the cube. Once triggered, the

211

212

delving below the surface

speed of the motors is mapped to the IAQ data e.g. 400PPM
causes very weak vibration, while 1500PPM causes strong vibration and so on. The final display was auditory (Figure 39,
A). In this cube I embedded a 50mm (diameter), 0.5W, 8–ohm
speaker. The frequency played through this speaker is mapped
to the value from the sensor; low value causes low frequency
sounds and visa versa.

Figure 40: The working components of the design probes

Following a series of informal tests in our design lab, I observed a flaw in the system. Although people had little difficulty triggering the representation, the majority spoke about
their difficulty in understanding its value. To address this issue
I incorporated a legend into each prototype, so the user can
map the current levels against two pre-defined levels of CO2
(fresh air and poor indoor air quality). To trigger these values
the user knocks on the side of the cube, one side for fresh air
and the adjacent side for poor IAQ. I choose knocking as the design study also showed it to be a common and familiar gesture
for participants. To capture the shaking gesture I used a tripleaxis accelerometer, while for the knocking gesture, I fixed two
5cm circular piezo elements to inside faces of the cube. The realtime CO2 levels are captured using a COZIR™ ambient sensor,
which measures the CO2 levels in the form of parts per million
(PPM) and is suitable for battery powered applications and has
a short warm-up period (1.2 seconds); other CO2 sensors that I

8.3 evaluation

tested either consumed too much power or had long warm-up
periods (> 5-seconds).
8.3

evaluation

The evaluation of the prototypes was conducted over two separate studies. The first was conducted in the lab with twelve
participants, and used the Repertory Grid technique to elicit
descriptions of participant’s experience of each probe. The second involved a different set of 12 participants, who were asked
to use one of the prototypes over the period of one week and
were then interviewed using the Elicitation Technique to recall
a memorable episode with the probe to provide a fine detailed
account of this experience. In the following sections I describe
the procedure and findings from both studies, to conclude I
collate the findings and present a description of how representational modality affects people’s experience of data.
8.3.1

The RepGrid Study

The aim of this phase is to explore people’s immediate response
to the probes, and to gather rich accounts about the meaning
they attribute to their description of each. To accomplish this,
the methodology I used is the RepGrid technique. The procedure followed is the same as described in Chapter 6, where I
introduced the adaptation of the RepGrid technique to accommodate a focus group session. In the following I briefly reiterate
on this procedure, before discussing the data gathered and the
results of the study.
8.3.1.1

Participants and Procedure

Twelve participants took part in the RepGrid study (6 female)
between 21 and 36 years (mean 23.2, SD 4.3). As the participants
demographic and background was not critical to the outcome
of the study I used a convenience sample, which was made up
of final-year design students who were studying in my place
of employment. I should note that I did not invite any student
who I have taught as I did not want to risk bias in the results.
The study was conducted in a large room where the three prototypes were placed on a table in the middle. The study commenced with a familiarization session, which involved introducing the three prototypes to the participants and then allow-

213

214

delving below the surface

ing time to interact with them. The participants were then divided into three groups of four, with each group spending a
20–minutes using a prototype before moving on to the next
one, until all the groups had used each prototype. This session lasted just over one-hour and I was present at all times
to answer any questions and to encourage the participants to
openly discuss their experience of using the prototypes. The
session was recorded using video- and audio-recording equipment with the transcriptions forming the principal data of the
analysis.
Once the familiarization session was complete, I conducted a
focus group session. The aim of this session was to establish a
list of bipolar personal constructs that describe the participant’s
experience of the prototypes. Using the minimum-context triad
technique, participants were asked to describe how two of the
prototypes are similar (Convergent pole) but differ from the
third (Divergent pole). Once the group reached consensus, the
personal construct, as well as the position of each prototype on
the bipolar dimension was recorded. In total fifteen personal
constructs emerged and form the basis of the RepGrid (see Table 12). The personal constructs (PC) are presented in the order
they were recorded during the focus group session, so PC 1
(Ambiguous - Precise) was the first to be established by the
group. The RepGrid not only contains the list of personal constructs agreed by the group, but also includes indicators that
show which end of the dimension each prototype should be
placed. For example, PC 1 (Ambiguous - Precise) shows that
the group agreed that the haptic and auditory prototype should
be described as ambiguous, but are unlike the visual prototype,
which they describe as being precise (see Table 12). In the following sections I trace the personal constructs back to the transcripts from the familiarization session, I focus on the four that
were most prominently referenced in the transcripts as well as
two that were not established during the focus group but were
included in the final RepGrid following close examination of
the transcripts. I then provide a description of the participant’s
experience of each modality by discussing the remaining personal constructs and presenting an extended extract from the
transcripts that typifies the experience participant’s had with
each prototype.

8.3.1.2

Analysis

The aim of examining the transcripts of the familiarization session is threefold: (1) to trace the emergence of the personal constructs, (2) to examine the meaning participant’s attribute to
the constructs, (3) to search for further constructs that may not
have been recorded in the focus group.
In the focus group session the participant’s agreed that the
haptic and auditory prototypes should be described as ambiguous and were unlike the visual prototype, which they described
as being precise (Table 12, PC1). When I examined the transcripts I found numerous exchanges between participants that
explain this decision further. For instance, in the following extract the group are using the audio prototype but are comparing it to the haptic and visual prototype:

215

216

delving below the surface

Participant 3: it is better than the haptic one, like when you are trying to understand where the shaky [real-time] one is
Participant 2: yea, but do you know that we are not getting an exact
measurement, like we can not tell if it is exactly seventy or whatever
in here, what if there was 3 or 4 distinct sounds, like a high sound
and a low sound and then something that would be more precise in
the middle
Participant 3: what would be more precise
Participant 2: I don’t know, like something that you are more familiar with, like the numbers, we all know that one hundred is different
from ninety, but how can you tell that in sounds.
This exchange shows that participant’s were aware that the
representation of data through sound is more precise than through
vibration, but neither is as clear as using numbers. However, in
a further exchange participant’s pointed out that while the use
of numbers may be more precise than the other modalities, it
might be still difficult to interpret the meaning associated with
the numbers:
Participant 3: ...like so what if has changed from 100 to 90, what
does that mean?
Participant 4: it might mean something is dangerous or you should
get yourself out of the room
Participant 2: but if you saw it changing from 100 to 90 in numbers
would that really tell you to leave the room
There also seemed to be some confusion about the mapping
of data to the sounds and vibrations. On occasions participants
spoke about having difficulty generating meaning from the auditory and haptic representations. The following extract illustrates this and was captured when the group were using the
auditory prototype:
Participant 7: The shaking gives you the reading for the room so you
know if it is really low or really high, or if the carbon dioxide levels
are high then you know that you need to do something
Participant 8: but if it is low frequency then does that mean that it
is low levels? and if it is high frequency then the levels are high?
Participant 6: do you think so?
Participant 7: yea it definitely is, I could hear that
Participant 6: but it should be the opposite way around
Participant 5: but it was the opposite way for me

8.3 evaluation

Participant 6: that is really weird
We can see here that some of the participants were unsure
whether high frequency sounds represented high CO2 levels
or visa versa. This was also evident on occasions when they
were using the haptic prototype, however, the transcripts did
not reveal any ambiguity with the visual prototype. The words
participants prominently used to describe the visual representation include: clear, precise, accurate, and exact. The following
extract illustrates this point:
Participant 4: this one is pretty much straightforward, there is no
messing around with it a number is a number to me and all of us,
isn’t it?
Participant 2: yea I suppose, it is not going to confuse any of us
Participant 1: I am not sure, 940 isn’t clear to me, I know it is pretty
high but
Participant 2: that’s all you need to know
Participant 1: yea I suppose
Participant 3: yea this one is pretty realistic
Participant 4: it is definitely the clearest one anyway
It is interesting to note that Participant 1 stated “940 isn’t
clear to me” but also acknowledges that he is aware that it is a
very high reading and when Participant 2 points out that this
is all he needs to know to generate meaning or make a judgement, he quickly agrees with her.
While PC1 (Ambiguous – Precise) relates to participant’s recognizing the representations as being inaccurate or accurate,
PC2 (Difficult to interpret - Easy to interpret) reflects how easy,
or not, the representations facilitated the generation meaning
or understanding. The group agreed that the haptic and auditory prototypes were difficult to interpret, whereas the visual
prototype was easy to interpret (Table 12, PC2). The following
exchange was recorded when Participant 6 and 7 were using
the audio prototype:
Participant 6: but the meaning of the sounds is always hard to identify
Participant 7: the meaning is really important, otherwise it is just a
music box
Participant 6: it’s not much of a music box

217

218

delving below the surface

Participant 7: ok a sound box
We can see here that these participant’s agreed if no meaning can be generated from a data representation (in this case
a sonification) then the purpose of the prototype changes from
a representation to something else. While it was evident in the
transcripts that the participant’s generated some level meaning
from all the modalities, on many occasions participant’s spoke
about having difficulty in doing so with the auditory and haptic prototypes. When describing the haptic prototype participant 4 said: “I think though if you are using this thing you would
spend a lot of time saying ’is that stronger, is that weaker?”’ Participant 6 echoed this when using the auditory prototype: “the
tones are so abstract that you can’t really make any sense of them”.
It was, however, quite the opposite with the visual prototype,
participants had very little difficulty interpreting the data. Participant’s spoke on many occasions about being immediately
aware of changes in the data representation as well as being
able to quickly interpret what these changes meant to them.
The following extract illustrates this:
Participant 10: it is good that you can see the difference; you know
you can see the numbers
Participant 11: yea it is definitely more accurate, you are only guessing with the other ones [audio and haptic]
Participant 12: yea I found myself guessing all the time with the audio one, but with this one there is no need to guess, it is there in front
of you, you don’t have to work at all when you read it, 1237 is 1237
all the time, but a sound is harder to interpret, to understand, to get
a grip on what it means.
During the focus groups session the participants agreed to
describe the haptic and visual modality as engaging but the auditory modality was described as non-engaging (Table 12, PC3).
In regards to the haptic modality, the transcripts suggest that
participants found this modality to be engaging because of the
multimodal nature of the prototype. On several occasions participants spoke about the sounds emitted from the motor reinforce the sensation felt in their hands, so they were relying
on two sensory channels instead of only one, which was the
case with the other prototypes. On one occasion a participant
remarked: “I think the sound is reinforcing the vibration, and it is
more engaging than when you just read off a screen”. Although the

8.3 evaluation

visual prototype cannot be described as multimodal the participants still described it as being engaging. This time the reason
for attributing this construct seems to be related to the participants’ ability to perceive subtle changes in the representation.
This may also be the reason why I observed participants shaking this prototype (requesting live data) more often than the
other two. In the following extract the participants involved are
using the visual modality, while talking about how they feel
compelled to request live data:
Participant 1: This is really addictive
Participant 2: Yea it is like a game, every time I shake it I get a different reading
Participant 1: That is because the levels are changing
Participant 2: But they should be changing for the others [prototypes] as well
Participant 1: Of course but you just can sense the changes, especially when the changes are small, with this you can see it change
even if it only changes by one
Participant 4: It’s like a compulsion, you would be constantly checking it
Participant 1: yea I could see myself constantly checking it
Of the three, the auditory modality was the only one participant’s described as non-engaging. I have also discussed how
the haptic modality seemed to engage participants through its
multimodal presentations of data and there is evidence in the
transcripts to show that the heightened level of engagement
with the visual modality was due to easy recognition of subtle
changes. These, however, do not apply to the auditory modality
as slight changes were difficult to interpret and only one sensory channel was required to perceive the data.
The participant’s agreed that the auditory and haptic modality should be described as narrow, while the visual modality
was experienced as being wide (Table 12, PC4). Upon inspection of the transcripts it became clear that the participant’s
made this determination based on their interpretation of the
scope or range of data that each modality could accurately represent. The transcripts show that participant’s were easily able
to distinguish differences between any data point when represented through the visual modality. This, however, was not
apparent when they used the haptic and auditory modality. Al-

219

220

delving below the surface

though there seemed to be little difficulty distinguishing large
differences, for example “you know a low tone and you know a high
tone” [Participant 2, Audio], all participants spoke about struggling with more subtle changes. The following extract highlights the difficulties two participant’s had in distinguishing
subtle changes when using the haptic prototype:
Participant 2: actually yea, when you shake it does feel a bit higher,
a small bit higher, I think, it is hard to tell maybe it is the way I am
holding it, you tell me what you think (passes the cube to Participant
3)
Participant 3: hmm, I feel them very very similar, they are quite similar, maybe there is a difference but I can’t tell through my hands
In comparison to this, the following extract illustrates how
the same participant’s had no difficulty distinguishing subtle
changes in the data when it was represented through the visual
modality. Interestingly the participant’s were not only aware of
small changes but could also approximate the percentage of
change over a given period of time.
Participant 2: it’s now 872, that has gone down, but it is hard to tell
by the air, did you notice a big drop in the CO2 ?
Participant 4: no, why would you? It hasn’t changed that much, has
it?
Participant 3: They have, the levels have dropped by 50% in the last
2 minutes and I haven’t really noticed anything
Participant 2: maybe you have oxygenated it?
Participant 3: how about you raise it up in the air, is there more or
less CO2 up there
Participant 4: 885
Participant 2: That’s a little more, what about down on the ground?
Participant 4: it’s 880 now.
The personal constructs discussed already were established
during the focus group session; however, the purpose of examining the transcripts is not only to add further meaning to the
agreed constructs but also to extract new personal constructs
that may have been missed during the focus group session.
When I examined the transcripts I identified evidence of two
personal constructs that were not already recorded by the participant’s. These are PC 13: (Evocative – Straightforward) and

8.3 evaluation

PC 14: (Mixes Senses -Single Modality).
Analysing the transcripts revealed that the participant’s experience of the auditory and haptic modality evoked memories
of past events and objects, whereas the visual modality did not
and was much more straightforward. When perceiving the data
through sound participants continuously compared it to other
sounds they have heard in the past, including, an ambulance,
siren, alarm, buzzing bees, dogs howling, to name but a few.
The following extract not only illustrates the participant’s recalling other sounds but they also use these sounds to better
understand the purpose of the prototype:
Participant 6: it sounds like Morse code
Participant 8: no, more like a dialup tone
Participant 4: yea
Participant 6: but Morse code is more like it cause that’s a kind of
communication as well, it could be words or numbers in sound
Participant 8: the dialup is numbers as well
Participant 6: is it?
Participant 8: well yea zeros and ones, it’s the sound of data being
transferred from one place to another, like this device.
There were also numerous occasions where the participant’s
recalled past events that were similar to the sensation provided
by the haptic modality. Sometimes this was used to help them
make sense from the data, such as comparing weak vibrations
to mobile phones and strong vibrations to “travelling on a train”;
on this occasion the participant used this bi-polar dimension
to judge where the real-time reading (vibration) was situated
along this dimension. There were other occasions where participant’s spoke more generally about communicating information through vibration. One group, when discussing how difficult it is to communicate precise information through vibration,
provided the analogy of the vibrations of an alarm clock, and
spoke about how it is alert you to wake up, but cannot tell you
the precise time. Another group spoke more viscerally about
their experience with vibrations:
Participant 4: I hate vibration
Participant 3: do you?
Participant 4: yea there is something about it that reminds you of
waking up or something

221

222

delving below the surface

Participant 2: yea it does
Participant 3: yea you can feel the vibration telling you to wake up
and get up now or even with computer games
Participant 4: when you get shot
Participant 3: yea when you get shot and the feedback when you are
getting shot, that is what this reminds me of, it doesn’t matter whether
it is high or low, it feels bad to me, I get a bad feeling when I hear or
feel it
Participant 2: it is never a good sign really when anything vibrates
Participant 4: no whenever something vibrates it is like I have to
wake up or there is a phone call, well a phone call isn’t always bad
Participant 3: yea but it only vibrates when your phone is on silent,
so then you probably don’t want to take a call, so it is still bad
Participant 4: that’s true
Participant 3: vibration is always bad!
These extracts show how participant’s recall past events to
help interpret data represented through the auditory and haptic modality. They also show how sometimes people’s perception of these modalities can be unduly influenced by past experiences, such as the last extract where some of the participant’s associated vibrations with a range of negative experiences. However, this was not the case with the visual modality.
The transcripts show no evidence of this modality evoking past
experiences, nor was there any evidence that showed participant’s explicitly recalling past experience to help interpret the
numbers. This is illustrated in the followed extract, which was
recorded when the group were using the visual prototype:
Participant 4: I think numbers are a good way of showing us what is
going on
Participant 2: yea I suppose, it is the exact reading you are getting
and there is no one else influencing it, you just look at the numbers
and it should be clear
Participant 3: yea not like the sound or vibration, they are influenced
by what you know already or what your feeling is about the sounds
or vibration
Participant 4: this one is pretty much straightforward, there is no
messing around with it a number is a number to me and all of us,
isn’t it?
Participant 2: yea I suppose, it is not going to confuse any of us
Participant 1: I am not sure, 940 isn’t clear to me, I know it is pretty
high but

8.3 evaluation

Participant 2: that’s all you need to know
Participant 1: yea I suppose
Another personal construct that was not recorded during the
focus group session, but was added to the RepGrid following
an examination of the transcripts is PC 15: (Mixes Senses - Single
Modality). There is evidence in the transcripts that shows participant’s becoming aware of more than one human sense being
used to perceive the haptic modality, however this was not the
case with the auditory or visual modality. With regards to the
haptic modality participant’s spoke on occasions about focusing on the sounds emitted from the vibrations to perceive the
data, this is illustrated here:
Participant 8: I am paying more attention to the sound than the vibration, even though it was supposed to be felt, do you know what I
mean?
Participant 11: yea
Participant 10: yea I wonder why that is? It’s probably we are more
used to sound
Participant 8: Yes, we are used to knowing the difference in sounds
While there were other occasions where the multimodal characteristic of the haptic prototype interfered with participants’
perception of the data, as illustrated here:
Participant 1: try shaking it
Participant 2: I can hear and feel that
Participant 1: it feels like it is a whole different vibration, but I don’t
know if I can fully feel the difference by feeling it
Participant 2: actually yea, when you shake it, it does feel a bit higher,
a pitch high speed even higher than high
Participant 1: Yea but the feeling and the sounds are not the same, it
feels way stronger than it sounds.
Although I did not find any evidence of participant’s referring to the multimodal aspects of the other modalities, on occasions participant’s spoke about wanting to augment the single modality with another to make the representation more engaging and easier to understand. For instance, when a group
was talking about how the auditory prototype could incorporate numbers into the representation to make it easier to understand, participant 6 explained: “we have the low and we have high

223

224

delving below the surface

and when it was just audio it is hard to understand where the realtime reading is, but if we had an accurate representation, like using
numbers or colours, then we would know exactly what the middle one,
700, really means”

representational modalities In the previous section I
discussed five of the fifteen personal constructs that make up
the RepGrid (Table 12). I now focus on the three representational modalities (haptic, visual and auditory), and use the constructs attributed to each modality and extended extracts from
the transcripts to provide a description of the participant’s experience of each.
Haptic Modality In the previous section I discussed five of
these personal constructs (Ambiguous, Engaging, Narrow, Difficult to interpret, Evocative, and Mixes Senses), I now discuss the
remaining dimensions attributed to the haptic modality (Unfamiliar, Passive, Physical, Tangible, Playful, Interpretive, Sonic, Invisible and Instinctual) to help provide a better understanding
of the participant’s experience with the haptic modality. During the focus groups session the participant’s agreed that the
haptic modality was unfamiliar to them. Although some spoke
about other devises that use vibration, including, for instance
mobile phones, these devises typically use vibration to generate an alert and the participants had little experience of it being used to communicate numerical data. The participants also
choose to use passive as a word to describe their experience
of the vibro–tactile feedback. While this may be due to wanting to describe the auditory modality as harsh, the transcripts
revealed, on occasions, participant’s describing the vibrations
as being “subtle” and “not obtrusive”, that it felt like a “tingle in my hand”. The participant’s also described the haptic
modality as being physical, as they could imagine the mechanics involved in producing the vibrations and the vibrations also
seemed to slightly alter depending on how they gripped the
devise. Although each devise could be described as a tangible
interface, the haptic modality was the only one that the participant’s describe as being tangible. There were numerous occasions where participants talked about having to use their hands
not only to trigger representations (shaking and knocking) but
with the haptic modality they also needed their hands to perceive the data. They also spoke about grasping the devise in

8.3 evaluation

different ways alerted their perception of the data, for instance:
Participant 4: I found that using only one hand doesn’t work for me
Participant 3: yea you seem to have to use the two hands
Participant 2: one-handed for me worked, but it is hard to feel it with
one, it feels better with two.
The way participants grasped the prototype not only affected
the perception of the vibration, but one participant spoke about
his grasp influencing his understanding of the data: “I would say
that the more of your hands are against it the more you would understand it”.
The RepGrid also shows that the participant’s consider the
haptic modality to be playful–a more informal way of communicating data. Some even spoke about the prototype being like
a game and considered it to be “fun to play with”. Similarly,
they agreed to describe it as being interpretive, instead of informative. The transcripts seem to show that what participant’s
meant by this is that the vibrations may be interpreted differently depending on the situation, such as, for instance, whether
this persons has had a positive or negative experience with vibrations. The reason for describing the haptic modality as being sonic is due to the sounds being emitted from the vibration
motors. Interestingly some participant’s spoke about the haptic
modality as being more ’sonic’ than the auditory as the vibrations made the sound waves feel more “physical”, “present”
and “real”. It is not surprising that the participant’s described
the haptic modality as being invisible. However, apart from occasions where participant’s spoke about being able to “look
around” when using the prototype, there is little evidence in
the transcripts that adds further meaning to the invisibleness
of this modality. The final construct used by the participants to
describe their experience of the haptic modality is Instinctual.
There were many occasions where participant’s spoke about
relying on their instinct to interpret the representational feedback. They also talked about, for instance, not being “taught
this at school” and “just knowing without thinking”. There is
a strong sense that the participant’s sometimes didn’t understand or could not explain how they generated insight from the
haptic representation. This is unlike the visual modality, where
they could easily provide a rationale about how they know the
number 400 is different from 500, on occasions they found it

225

226

delving below the surface

difficult to justify how one feeling felt different from another.
I present the following extract as an illustration of the participant’s experience with the haptic modality. In this short exchange the participant’s refer to the ambiguous nature of the
representation, and while they also seem to struggle focusing
on one modality when perceiving the data, the representation
evokes memories from the past.
Participant 2: can you feel the difference?
Participant 3: it is like a tiny bit weaker
Participant 2: it is the sound that you can feel more than the actual
vibration
Participant 1: but if it is an object that you have to hold then the
vibrations are better
Participant 3: the low is definitely a tiny bit weaker, I think the low
is weaker, it kind of feels like a pump I have used before, like bump,
bump, bump, bump
Participant 1: maybe you would feel it better then if it was pulsing
more, like if it was high it would pump out 12 pulses
Participant 4: I almost feel like the low one is much stronger
Participant 2: that’s what I thought
Participant 1: I find it hard to feel the difference, shake it there and
see what you feel

Auditory Modality Based on the constructs participant’s attributed to each modality during the focus group session, the
auditory and haptic modality are more similar than any other
combination, sharing ten dimensions of the personal constructs.
The auditory and visual share three while the haptic and visual
share only two. Alongside those discussed already (Ambiguous, Narrow, Difficult to interpret, Playful, Interpretive, Sonic, Evocative, Invisible, Single Modality and Instinctual), the participant’s
agreed to describe their experience of the auditory modality as
Familiar, Non-engaging, Harsh, Digital, and Non-tangible.
Although the RepGrid indicates participant’s considered the
auditory modality to be familiar, the transcripts seem to suggest that this only occurred when the frequency of the sounds
were either very low or high. There were many other occasions
where participant’s suggested that the sounds between these
were unfamiliar to them. For instance, when one group were

8.3 evaluation

having difficulty interpreting a sound, one participant spoke
about “it is not all the time we hear things like that in this way”. On
a number of other occasions participant’s spoke about there
wish for the sounds to be musical notes or even speech, they
suggested that these familiar sounds would be easier to interpret than digitally generated tones.
The auditory modality was also the only one described as
being harsh. When examining the transcripts I found many occasions where participant’s were complaining about the “unpleasant” and “piercing” sounds being emitted from the prototype. This was mainly as a consequence of particularly high
readings during the study, which was conducted indoors, with
no natural ventilation and the room was occupied at all times
by thirteen people. Although these harsh sounds did not seem
to appeal to the participant’s, there were occasions when they
spoke about them acting as a good alert, for example:
Participant 12: these sounds seem to alert you more than the vibration, these sounds are almost painful, something like it is trying to
warm us, where the vibration was just like a sensation, it didn’t really
hurt me
Participant 9: the vibration was more subtle than this, subtle or
maybe a bit boring, not boring, the numbers are boring, but the vibration didn’t really alert or warn us
Unlike the haptic modality, which was described as being
physical, the auditory was described as being digital. The transcripts show that this judgement seemed to be based on the
participant’s perceiving the sounds as “artificial”, “computer
generated” and “manufactured”. The reason for attributing the
construct maybe due to the type of sound emitted from auditory prototype. This sound was a computer generated auditory
signal, so it could be argued that this construct would not have
been ascribed to the auditory modality of the sounds were more
natural or organic.
They also considered this modality to be non-tangible. Although the transcripts show occasions where the participant’s
were aware of having to place the prototype close to their ear to
hear the sounds, they did not consider this mode of perception
to be tangible, as it did not require them to touch the prototype

227

228

delving below the surface

when perceiving the data.
The following extract typifies the participant’s experience of
the auditory modality. In this exchange the group are discussing
the potential of augmenting the sounds with numbers, to produce and more accurate (less ambiguous) representation. They
also reference how our perception of sounds maybe instinctual
(for some); however, some sounds may be unpleasant to hear
and could interfere with our understanding of them.
Participant 4: but that would take away from what it is, its an auditory reading not numbers, so it would turn into a numbers thing
then
Participant 2: but it would be an accurate representation of it then
Participant 4: but they are both accurate, it is just we see or hear
them different
Participant 2: no, numbers are more accurate than sounds
Participant 1: what do you mean
Participant 2: we all know numbers, no matter where we live or what
we do, but not everyone will understand the difference between two
sounds
Participant 1: I think we would, sure don’t we know that one sound
is higher than another, or one sound is louder than another, we know
loads about sounds
Participant 2: but we know more about numbers, we use them all the
time to make calculations and the like, numbers are better, they are
faster and more accurate
Participant 3: but sounds are universal, even animals would recognise the difference between 2 sounds or babies or young children who
don’t know how to read they all will know the difference between two
sounds
Participant 2: yea but does a dog or a baby know that a high pitch
sound means danger and a low one not
Participant 3: why does a high one mean danger?
Participant 2: well think about alarms, ambulances, fire alarms, they
all are high for a reason, they alert us about danger
Participant 4: maybe it is because we associate them with danger, a
baby may not because they haven’t learned to yet
Participant 3: yea same as the numbers then, you have to learn how
to use both of them
Participant 2: but not in the same way, you don’t do sounds in school,
well not in my school anyway, you do sounds on your own, you just
pick them up along the way

8.3 evaluation

Participant 3: but I would get sick if I heard that high pitch 12 times
Participant 2: but then you would know what it is then
Participant 3: but I think it is just like a general representation really,
you know, like if it is too high it is going to sound like
Participant 4: yea you would notice
Participant 3: yea

Visual Modality The RepGrid (Table 12) shows that ten of
the fifteen dimensions of the personal constructs are unique to
the visual modality. In the sections above I already discussed
eleven of these (Precise, Familiar, Engaging, Passive, Digital, Nontangible, Wide, Easy to interpret, Informative, Straightforward and
Single Modality), I now discuss the remaining four (Logical, Silent,
Visible, and Knowledgeable) and provide further insight into their
meaning and show how they impress on the participant’s experience of the visual modality.
To start with, two of these dimensions represent the participant’s awareness of fundamental characteristics of this modality (Silent and Visible). Although it should be no surprise that
these constructs would be used to describe the visual modality,
the transcripts show that the main reason they were assigned
was as a consequence of describing the other modalities as invisible and sonic. There were, however, some occasions where
participants spoke about having to look at a display to perceive
the data, which usually meant that more than one person could
not share the experience. For instance, when one group were using the visual prototype the conversation was led by the person
who was using the prototype and he was providing a commentary on the changes in the data representation:
Participant 12: [holding the cube] It has gone up quite a bit.
Participant 11: What is it now?
Participant 12: 745
Participant 8: what was it before
Participant 11: 720 or maybe 710
Participant 10: and what’s it now?
Participant 12: wait,... it’s still 745, hold on, no it’s now 749
Participant 11: show me, it’s a pity we can’t all see it

Participant 9: I’d prefer to see it myself
Participant 12: but that’s the same as the vibrations, not all of us can

feel it
Participant 9: at the same time anyway
I should note, in this extract, while the participant’s seemed
to be frustrated with not being able to share their direct experience of the representation, they acknowledge this occurs
with the haptic modality also. Describing the visual modality as
silent may be seen as obvious as considering the visual modality to be visible, and to some extent it says more about the
participant’s experience of the other modalities than it does
about this one. Looking beyond these dimensions the two remaining (Logical and Knowledgeable) offer much more richer insight about the visual modality.
When the participant’s agreed to describe their experience
of the visual modality as being logical they distinguished it
from the other two modalities, which they described as playful. I have already shown that participant’s perceived the auditory and haptic modality to be a fun and enjoyable experience,
this, however, was not the case for the visual modality. When
the transcripts were examined they seemed to show that this
perception related to the use of numbers instead of the visual
modality in general. There were occasions where participant’s
described the use of numbers as being ubiquitous (“numbers
are everywhere, every gadget has them”, [P12, Visual] and the most
common form of raw data: (“data is numbers, numbers is data,
it’s boring to convert them into something else”, [P8, Visual]. There
were also other occasions where participant’s talked more positively about the use of numbers, for instance:
Participant 4: I think numbers are a good way of showing us what is
going on
Participant 2: yea I suppose it is the exact reading you are getting
and there is no one else influencing it, you just look at the numbers
and it should be clear
Participant 3: yea not like the sound or vibration, they are influenced
by what you know already or what your feeling is about the sounds
or vibration
The logical dimension used to describe the visual modality
was conceived by the participants in a positive and negative
way. In some cases participant’s enjoyed the easy access to information and knowledge that is offered by numbers, but this

8.3 evaluation

may also result in an overly familiar but underwhelming experience. Much like the auditory modality, the choice of constructs maybe related to the properties of the output and not
the modality in general. For instance, it is not clear whether
the participants would describe the visual modality as being
logical if the representation used colours instead of numbers,
as colours may require more interpretation and are less precise
and logical than numbers.
In contrast to the other modalities, participants consider the
visual modality to require some prior knowledge to interpret
the data. They accepted that humans have an innate ability
to recognise differences in sounds and vibrations, but visuals
(in this case numbers) require some form of formal learning. I
found numerous examples of participant’s talking about how
easy it is to interpret subtle differences when using the visual
modality, however, on many occasions this recognition did not
result is a better understanding of the data. For instance, when
one of the groups were comparing the visual and auditory
modality participant 11 explained: “I like the way the last one
[audio] has an alarming sense to it, but this one is just like 600, the
numbers don’t have any real meaning”.
The following extract also references the logical and knowledgeable aspects of the visual modality, as well as other attributes, including, informative, precise and familiar:
Participant 2: oh it is 708 now
Participant 3: yea I can definitely tell that that has changed
Participant 4: yea it is definitely the most informative one of them,
or the most engaging
Participant 1: I think that one [audio] is the most engaging, maybe
cause the sounds keep changing, where as with this you just know it
when you see it you don’t have to think very much, but the others you
have to think more about the meaning
Participant 3: I think that one [vibration] is even more engaging because we had to really concentrate on what it was
Participant 4: I think, I guess, that if I had one of these [visual]
I wouldn’t find it very interesting, I think I would find it a bit too
scientific, a bit boring, where those two [audio and vibration] are bit
more playful
Participant 2: I would have though that we would like this one the
best because it is the quickest one at giving you the correct informa-

tion, like if you wanted to know quickly what the air was like
Participant 1: yea if you wanted the information straight away
Participant 2: yea, like you get it instantly

8.3.1.3

Summary of Phase One

In this phase I conducted a RepGrid study in form of a focus
group to study participant’s experience with the three design
probes. The results of this echo some of the findings from Chapter 6 and show that the auditory and haptic modality produces
a very similar experience, which is unlike that of the visual
modality. The RepGrid produced during the focus group session contains fifteen bi-polar personal constructs, ten of whose
dimensions are shared by the auditory and haptic modality.
The discussion in this section first focused of five of the constructs that shows auditory and haptic representations can be
ambiguous and are difficult to interpret, and while they sometimes evoke past events, they do not allow for the perception
of subtle changes, the opposite in all these cases is true for the
visual modality. Further discussion highlighted other aspects
of the modalities, most notably: (1) the awareness of the tangible properties of the haptic modality and how grasping the
interface may affect the interpretation of the data, (2) the capacity of the auditory and haptic modality to evoke memories
of past events and to use these memories to interpret the data,
(3) the multimodal nature of the haptic modality and how easily people switch between modalities when perceiving the data,
and (4) the recognition that the visual modality requires prior
knowledge but the other two modalities can be instinctively interpreted.
8.3.2

The Elicitation Interview Study

For the final phase of this project I invited another twelve people to participate in a study that involved giving each of them a
prototype to use in their work or home life for a period of one
week. At the end of the week each participant was interviewed
about a memorable episode they had with the prototype. The
purpose of this study was to gather accounts of this episode
that would reveal fine-grained details about how they experienced the prototype. The transcripts of these interviews would
then be analysed with the aim of finding patterns between peo-

8.3 evaluation

ple who used the same prototype as well as comparing the experience people have with the three representational modalities.
In the following I first describe the procedure, before discussing
the analysis of the data gathered before presenting the key findings of this study.

8.3.2.1

Participants and Procedure

Twelve participants (five males) between 19 and 45 years (mean
28.1, SD 9.2) agreed to take part in the study, none of who
were involved in either of the two previous studies. Each participant had a diverse background, including a research assistant,
a graphic designer, an accountant, a teacher, a computer technician, a multimedia producer, a professional athlete, a secretary,
a university lecturer, a computer programmer, a computer science student and a stay at home parent. Before the study commenced, the participants were divided into three groups of four,
and each group were assigned a different prototype (group 1:
audio, group 2: visual, group 3: haptic). Over the course one
week each participant was given one prototype to take home
for up to one week. Before taking possession of the prototype
I meet with them individually to explain the purpose of the
study and also to demonstrate the use the prototype. They were
also provided with my contact details if they had any difficulties with the prototypes. At the end of the week I collected the
prototype from their home and I also conducted an Elicitation
interview with them.
All interviews followed the same procedure outlined in Chapter 7 and started by agreeing on a memorable episode the participant had when using the prototype, once agreed this episode
was used as the basis of the interview. As outlined in Chapter 7,
an important aspect of the elicitation technique is to focus the
interview around a singular experience that the participant has
a clear memory of. The episodes chosen by the participant’s
were all different and varied from the first time using the prototype, a moment of insight, a moment of confusion, the last time
they used the prototype etc. The interview started by asking
the participant a series of questions that were aimed at guiding
them back to the place and time of the agreed episode. This
included questions such as:

233

234

delving below the surface

“When did this episode happen? Where were you at the time?” The
line of questioning that followed included sensory questions,
similar to those described in Chapter 7, to help guide the participant toward a state of evocation.
Each of the twelve interviews lasted just under a half an hour
on average and was video- and audio-recorded, resulting in a
total of just less than six hours of material for transcription.
The resulting transcripts included the verbal dialogue as well
as non- and para-verbal cues, including, for instance: speech
tempo, pauses, facial expressions, hand and body gestures and
eye directions.

modalities (total number of codes: 424).

8.3.2.2

Data Analysis

The transcripts were analysed using Thematic Analysis, again
following the same procedure described in Chapter 5 and Chapter 7. This involved five discrete phases: (1) familiarization, (2)
thematic coding, (3) extracting themes, (4) reviewing themes,
and (5) defining and naming themes. (Please see Chapter 7,
for a detailed description of these phases). During the analysis 424 codes (72 unique) were applied to the transcripts (see
Figure 41 for distribution of representational modality across
these codes). Based on these codes, 16 themes emerged; Table 13 shows these themes alongside their definition, prominent
codes and illustrative quotes. Before finalising the themes that
would be included in further analysis I removed any theme
that included 10 or less thematic codes. The reason I applied
this rule was so that we could focus our enquiry on the most

8.3 evaluation

prominent themes that emerged from this part of the analysis.
Some themes that were removed include: Eagerness (6 codes),
Talking about modalities (6), Confirming (5), Curiosity (4), Strategy (4), Focusing (3). The themes that did surpass the threshold
include; demonstrating an awareness of their body during the
interaction (Table 13, Theme A), the way we make sense out of
data (Table 13, Theme B), the way we find meaning from the
data (Table 13, Theme C), and the use of spatial and visual cues
to assist sense-making and meaning-making (Table 13, Theme
E & F). In the following I discuss these six themes at length as
well highlighting issues that arise from the other ten themes.

Table 13: Themes (in bold) and codes that emerged during the analysis of the transcripts. The numbers in the themes column
refer to the number of occurrences of the codes.

an awareness of body Analysing the interview transcripts
highlighted numerous instances where participants commented
on their body or body parts when recalling their experience
with the prototype (Table 13, Theme A: Awareness of Body).
Although it would be quite normal for this topic to arise when
interviewing people about their experience with interactive systems, especially tangible systems, I highlight specific moments
of participant’s becoming aware of their body when interpreting the data. Nine out of twelve participants spoke about the position and placement of their hands when using the prototypes.
For obvious reasons, participants who used the haptic interface
were more likely to mention their hands, but there were also
some instances with the audio display. Alongside the interactions that are required to trigger the representations (knocking
and shaking), participants also talked, on numerous occasions,
about holding, touching, grasping, and feeling the prototypes.
The following extract illustrates such a dialogue:
“I did the high value first, so I held it on the low side, with my
left hand and knock with my right hand where it says high.”, [MC,
Audio].
There are also examples where participants talked about using their hands to perceive the data, for example, when asked
how he knew there was a change in the data DM explained:

241

242

delving below the surface

DM: I just know
Interviewer: how do you know, please try to go back to that time
when you know that you know and tell me how you know that you
know, I am not trying to confuse you I would just like to know how
you know you know.
DM: it is in my hands, it feels different, the sensation is much different (looks down at his hands)
Interviewer: how is it different?
DM: it is like much stronger in my hands, I mean the sensation is
much more harsh, what I feel is much harsher.
Participant’s also talked about how they use their body to recall haptic sensations. On more than one occasion participants
spoke about recalling these sensations from within their body,
sometimes inside their head and others inside their chest or
hands. When asked to explain and elaborate on this process
KP said:
KP: I feel the vibration and I think back to what it was like before
Interviewer: how do you think back?
KP: I have a feeling stored in my mind and I recall that when I want
to compare it
Interviewer: so you recall the sensation from the morning [i: yea] so
how do you recall this, how does this appear?
KP: it doesn’t appear, I don’t see it
Interviewer: ok so you don’t see it, so how does it appear to you, if I
ask you to try to recall it now could you?
KP: yes I am sure I can (pause 4 secs, stares into space) yea it is like
it is in me (points to his chest)
Interviewer: in your chest? (mirrors the gesture)
KP: yea in, somewhere in there (points into chest again)
Interviewer: ok so if we go back to when you are standing with the
cube in the air and you are feeling the sensation, do you feel it now?
KP: not at the same time, I feel the new sensation in my hands and
the old one inside me.
Another aspect of this theme is the way people talked about
their body position when perceiving the data representation.
There were many instances where participant’s spoke about
standing, sitting, walking and bending down, for example:
“I actually stood up and brought it over to the door because I
wanted to see what the levels were outside, were they any different

8.3 evaluation

outside.” [DME, Audio].
I also found examples where participant’s spoke about moving the prototype towards themselves to help with the perception of the data:
“I put it up to my ear so I could hear it better because am because
the ambient noise in the room” [MC, Audio].
While the motivation here may be to block out external distractions when perceiving the data, the following extract illustrates how moving ones own body can also be a distraction
when engaging in cognitive tasks, such as in this case perceiving data:
Interviewer: ok so you shake it again
MC: yes I move it around a bit and I shake it
Interviewer: so you move it around and you are still shaking it, are
you shaking it while it is vibrating?
MC: no I stop shaking while it is buzzing, it’s hard to feel it when it
is moving and I want to focus on the vibrations
Interviewer: so you focus on the vibrations [MC: yea] how do you
focus on the vibrations
MC: I stay still, don’t move and wait for them to finish
Interviewer: so you stay still
MC: yea and wait until I know what they mean, I mean until I get
something from them
The theme ’Awareness of Body’ is made up of more codes
than any other theme (59), this alone illustrates the significance
participant’s place on their body parts, position or posture when
interpreting data. What is particularly revealing about these
thematic codes is there distribution across the modalities, out
of the 59 codes only 3 came from the transcripts of participant’s
using the visual representation, the remaining were distributed
evenly across the audio (27) and haptic (29) representation. This
may indicate that the auditory and haptic modality heightens
people’s awareness of their body when interacting with systems. In line with this, researchers in cognitive science have
long since recognised the role hands play in cognitive tasks,
such as thinking, remembering and perceiving [139]. Recent research in tangible computing and InfoVis also supports these
theories and reports how people make extensive use of their
hands to support the interpretation of data represented through

243

244

delving below the surface

physical forms [113] [123]. I believe what I have shown in this
theme echoes the findings in this research, but also draws attention to other aspects, such as movement, proximity, and the
internal (mental) body, all of which necessitate further investigation.

making sense verses meaning making The generation
of insight is one of the key objectives of data representation and
it is often included in definitions of information visualization
(cf. [34]). While the study of data insight is broadly covered in
InfoVis (cf. [207]), there is still no agreed definition or empirical studies that have explored the conditions that support or
foster data insight. A key reason for employing the Elicitation
technique in this study was to shed light on the activities that
surround this process, as it would allow me to gather detailed
accounts by encouraging participants to focus on recalling what
is commonly called an “a-ha” or “eureka” moment [169].
While many of the themes shown in Table 13 could be associated with the generation of data insight, I focus here on two in
particular (Theme B: Making Sense & Theme C: Meaning Making). During the first round of coding the transcripts I used
codes such as sense-making and meaning-making interchangeable. However, in subsequent iterations, after closer examination of the codes, I decided some instances should be coded
as “Making Sense”, while others should be “Meaning making”.
The reason being I identified cases where participant’s recalled
moments where they were attempting to interrogate or find patterns in the data and others where they were trying to contextualise the data or generate meaning from it. I delineate these
themes as I consider making-sense to be a process, whereas
meaning making is an outcome. They are, however, both key
phases along the trajectory of generating data insight.
To elucidate this point further, let me, for a moment, focus
on sense-making. All participants spoke on occasion about the
processes involved in making sense of the data. Sometimes this
involved trying to find patterns, for example:
“I try the shake again and move it about a few times until I find a
pattern.” [DM, Haptic], and “I was trying to find a pattern, I was
tying to (pause 1 sec) I was trying to find a pattern between the vibra-

8.3 evaluation

tion levels.”, [JC, Haptic].
There were also instances where participants talked about
employing different strategies to compare the real-time representation with those in the legend. The following statement exemplifies this:
“after I listen to it I compare what I have listened to before, from
the low and the high and then in my own mind I try to put the sound
what I have just heard from the reading into a kind of graph or spectrum of where it is between the two points.” [CN, Audio].
It should be noted that CN has yet to form any meaning from
the data at this point he is processing the representations before
he makes any judgements. Making sense of the data can also involve checking or confirming that the readings are trustworthy,
for example, here JC is not sure whether she has interpreted a
false reading from the haptic prototype:
JC: I try the shake again and move it about a few times until I find a
pattern
Interviewer: a pattern?
JC: well sort of a pattern, its like I move the cube to a place where the
smoke looks as bad and if the reading is pretty much the same then I
know that the first reading was right. If I feel that it is different then
the first reading could be wrong as well.
What differentiates this statement from the previous is JC has
already formed meaning, but she is not confirming whether the
data was valid. It could be argued that the second interpretation does not yield any new meaning, instead it is used to endorse the insight that has been gathered already.
Although crossing the rubicon–from the mental processing of
data to making judgements and forming meaning and knowledge–
can happen very fast, there is a clear delineation between the
two. This is illustrated in the following statement when JC describes a moment from her interaction with the haptic prototype:
JC: I was trying to find a pattern, I was tying to (pause 1 sec) I was
trying to find a pattern between the vibration levels
Interviewer: the high and the low?

245

246

delving below the surface

JC: yea, between the high and the low [i: ok] and I was wondering
then if am, if the room, because this room was, it was a little bit stuffy,
it wouldn’t have a lot of air going into it, I was wondering whether
that was hampering the results that I was getting.
We can see here that JC was seeking to find a pattern between
different data streams (high and low values), and although she
does not explicitly mention the moment she finds the pattern,
she says “I was wondering then if, am, if the room.” This, I believe,
is the moment (the rubicon) where she has moved from making sense to making meaning from the data, as she begins to
speak about external factors that may influence her judgement,
as well as starting to make reference to the data source and the
consequences of the readings.
I should also note that the distribution of modalities across
these themes were relatively even, although the frequency of
codes extracted from transcripts using the visual modality was
still less than the others in Theme B: Making Sense (visual: 9,
audio: 20, haptic: 23), Theme C: Meaning Making was more
evenly spread (visual: 16, audio: 11, haptic: 16).

using spatial and visual cues Seven out of the twelve
participants revealed that they use mental cues to assist the
processing of information, these either manifested in spatial or
visual forms. While two of the participants acknowledged they
were unaware of using these cues at the time of interacting with
the prototypes, the others only became aware of these activities
during the interview and the elicitation technique helped them
to recall these cognitive activities in rich detail.
Regarding the use of spatial cues, five participants recalled
the moment immediately after perceiving a data representation,
where a mental marker-which represents the data would appear in front of them. Once they perceive the next data point,
they then place another mental maker next to the previous one
and they use the proximity between them to judge the difference between the two data representations. The following extract illustrates such a dialogue, when TH is recalling how he
compares different audio representations:

8.3 evaluation

TH: I have one sound here (points his two hands out in front) and
then the other one is here (moves his left hand to his left) they are
on this bar and if they are the same they will be on top of each other
but these are not, there is a bit of distance between them so they are
different.
Interviewer: ok so do you see this bar?
TH: am (pause 2-seconds and stares into space) no I don’t, it is there
but I don’t see it, its like I know there is something there but I don’t
see a picture of it but there are two sounds on it.
It is interesting to note that TH acknowledges that he does
not see the bar that he uses to place the markers on, although
he is sure that it is there.
There were also similar instances with others using the haptic display, for instance, when KP spoke how he recalled and
compared haptic representations:
“it is just like (2-second pauses)... its just how I placed it with my
head maybe... I just place it closer to the high sound than to the low.”,
[KP, Audio].
MC also recalled using a similar strategy to make sense of
the auditory representation:
“I see it as two sides, it is closer to the lower side or the higher
side (waves his hand from left to right) and so there is a, it is like a
pendulum, which way is it going towards”.
It should be noted that only one participant used a similar
strategy with the visual display. When recalling her experience
of comparing three visual representations SH said:
“I am just thinking about (pause 3-seconds) am, where it would fall
between the two on a number line, would it be closer to this end of the
scale (draws line with hands and then moves both hands to the left)
than it would be up here (moves right hand over to the right)”.
These examples show how these participants translate the
differences between the representations that they hear, feel and
see into the spatial proximity of mental objects that appear (in
their minds). So, for instances, the change of pitch in a sound is
translated into the distance between the markers that represent
the sounds. When probed further about these markers most

247

248

delving below the surface

described them as three-dimensional shapes, such as boxes,
blocks or spheres. However, one participant (SH, visual) described them as being numbers, but not the same as those used
on the prototype:
“they are numbers [interviewer: ok] yea they are characters (2second pause) am actually what do you call it, I actually know (3second pause, then draws the number in the air with her fingers) that
kind of font, it was from my old maths book or something, [interviewer: ok] something like that”.
The transcripts also revealed a similar strategy that involved
using visual cues to interpret the data. Unlike the previous
example, which manifested in three–dimensional space, these
tended to appear on a two-dimensional plane and included visual variables such as colour, pattern and shape. The following
statement illustrates this:
“I visualize them, the audio feedback, I am visualizing it as a frequency (points finger into space) so a peak, I am imagining a high
peak (draws a peak with his finger) for a high sound and a lower, more
rounded waveform, for a lower sound”. [MC, Audio].
In the following statement CN, who also used the auditory
prototype, and describes a similar process but in greater detail:
CN: so I characterise green with low and red with high
Interviewer: ok
CN: so I am seeing a square on a page, a green square (raises left hand)
and a red square (raises right hand) on each side and then the reading,
there is another square (points to the middle) in between those two
Interviewer: OK OK, and when you are comparing them, you say
they are objects, they have colour, are they here in front of you or far
away
CN: am (pause 3-seconds, stares into space) yea they are just like, I
don’t want to say a hallucination or like (laughs) its just like visualizing it in front of you (points to a space 20 cm away from his eyes)
Interviewer: ok and is it a clear image or is it fuzzy?
CN: (stares into space) its just am (pause 3-seconds) its just like, its
just like a passive thing, its just like instant (clicks fingers) its not
like something you are concentrating on, its just like a way of taking
the information I have been given and just like trying to understand it.

8.3 evaluation

It should be noted that both of these participants described
visuals that are similar to those used commonly in everyday
data visualizations. CN incorporated simple coloured shapes,
on what he implied was a printed page, and used the distance
between these to gauge the differences or similarities between
multiple data points. This description is very similar to the visualization technique: Scatter Plot (see Figure 42, A). MC recalled
visuals that were more complex than CN’s, albeit very similar
to a visualization technique that is commonly used to represent audio frequencies, such as a Spectrograph (see Figure 42,
B). Using this strategy may be due to the ubiquitous nature of
these visualization techniques today, so even when people perceive data through an alternative modality – in this case sound
– there seems to be a tendency to employ methods from traditional visualizations to make sense of the data.

8.3.2.3

Other Thematic Observation

The five themes discussed already represent the highest frequency of codes, incorporating nearly 50% of the total amount
(210/424). There are, however, other themes that reveal interesting aspects about the participant’s experience with the prototypes. Instead of reviewing these themes individually, in the
following, I discuss topics that are derived from the remaining
themes and then briefly address similar patterns that appear
between this elicitation study and the one described in Chapter 7
comparing data The Themes B to D (see Table 12), which I
discussed already, exposed aspects of insight generation, which
ranged from making sense to finding meaning, and involved
spatial and visual cues to help this process. The transcripts also

249

250

delving below the surface

revealed another aspect of insight generation that involved participants seeking to compare different data representations (Table 12, Theme F: Comparing Data). The codes attributed to this
theme could have equally been applied to Theme B (Making
Sense) or Theme C (Meaning Making); however, I decided that
there were different enough to treat them independently and
also this theme (Comparing Data) reveals aspects of data experience that I was unable to uncover in the previous study. In
Chapter 7, I explored people’s experience with static data visualizations. These visualizations did not require any interaction
(apart from reading) and represented static archived data that
was visible to the participants at all times. The prototypes used
in this study represent real-time and archived data, however,
participants could only perceive one data representation at a
time. By employing this feature it required participants to recollect past representations to compare them with the present,
and the elicitation technique offered me a procedure to gather
detail accounts about how this was accomplished.
Earlier, I showed how participants used spatial and visual
cues when comparing different data. The participants also revealed other ways of comparing data that were equally cognitive but did not involve using mental props. The following
statement illustrates this:
“The next step is to take that in and give that a place in my mind,
to use it to compare with the high, when I knock on the high side for
the high reading.”, [CN, Audio].
When probed to explain this process further and to explain
how he compares the sound the is hearing with one from the
past, CN stated:
“I put it to my ear (puts both hands over his ears) and I compare
the two (makes swirling gesture with fingers) to try to find a medium
in my head, what the difference is between the low and the high.”
While this shows CN attempting to make sense of the data,
there were also instances where participants compared different data in an attempt to form meaning:
“I compare the vibrations, then I know what they mean, its pretty
fast really I am not even sure it lasts longer than a second, it’s just

8.3 evaluation

like that (clicks his fingers) then it is over.”, [DM, Haptic].
This statement not only shows DM generating meaning from
comparing data, but it also demonstrates how fast this process
felt. When probed to elucidate further on it DM had difficulties
in recalling details about what was happening at the time and
following multiple attempts he said:
“you just know, it’s like I just know that this one (holds out hand)
is much stronger that this one (points to his chest) it must be a human
thing but I know that it is different, I wasn’t taught it I just feel it.”
While the words he uses does not disclose much, apart from
relying on instinct (see also Table 13, Theme P: Using Instinct),
the hand gestures he using indicate that he is comparing an
external sound (holds out hand), with a sound that is now internal (points to his chest).

distribution of codes The procedure I followed to analyse the data in this study is similar to the study described in
Chapter 7, however, in this study I conducted an additional analytical phase to quantitatively explore the distribution of representational modalities across the themes. The reason for adding
this phase here is that this study incorporated three prototypes
and my intention was to compare people’s experience across
the different modalities, whereas the primary aim of the previous study was to investigate the potential of the elicitation
interview technique.
Figure 43 shows the make up of the sixteen themes, with the
pie chart slices representing the proportion of thematic codes
from each modality (audio, visual and haptic). Before focusing
on the individual themes, it should be noted the distribution of
codes across all the modalities represents a significant different
between the visual modality and the other two. Figure 41 shows
the visual modality accounting for less than half of the codes
attributed to either of the other modalities (Visual: 73, Audio:
194, Haptic: 157). While it is difficult to provide a reason for this
discrepancy, it could be surmised that the novelty of the other
modalities may have simulated more in-depth recall by the participant that was not present with the relevant ubiquitous and

251

252

delving below the surface

Figure 43: Distribution of representational modalities across the
themes established during the analysis of the elicitation
interview transcripts.

8.3 evaluation

familiar nature of the visual modality.
While each pie chart represents noteworthy information about
the themes, in the following I focus on specific themes that
illustrate significant discrepancies. Before I focus on these individual anomalies, let me, for a brief moment, reiterate on
two themes that demonstrate a relatively equal distribution of
modalities. As mentioned already, Theme C (Meaning Making)
and to a slightly lesser extent Theme B (Making Sense) incorporate equal amount of codes from all three modalities. These
are the only two themes that display this characteristic. This
may indicate that making sense and meaning is a fundamental
process when interpreting data no matter what the representational modality is.
I now draw attention to certain variances that are visible in
Figure 43. First is the distribution and instances of thematic
codes from participants who used the visual modality. In particular, while Theme A (Awareness of Body) has only 3 from a
total of 59 codes, Theme G (Awareness of Technology) does not
include any. In my earlier discussion on body awareness, I described and defined this theme as demonstrating an awareness
of body position during the interaction, as well as talking about
using hands and other body parts as well as the describing the
position of the data representation in relation to the body or
body parts. The spread of modalities in this theme show these
activities primarily occurred with the auditory and hapic prototype, whereas, apart from rare instances, the visual prototype
does not seem to make people aware of their body when interacting with the prototype. This pattern maybe attributed to the
manner in which people perceive hapic and auditory representations. While the haptic modality is perceived through direct
contact with the body, to fully appreciate and perceive sounds,
it is sometime required to bring the source closer to the persons
ear. The following statement illustrates such a case:
“I put it up to my ear so I could hear it better because [of] the ambient noise in the room.”, [MC, Audio].
Becoming aware of the technology used in the prototypes
(Table 13, Theme G: Awareness of Technology) is associated
primarily with experiencing auditory data representations (13
codes), however there were some instances with the haptic in-

253

254

delving below the surface

terface (6 codes). However, I did not observe participant’s recalling such awareness when using the visual modality. Again
this may be attributed to the ubiquitous nature of the visual interface. While participant’s often demonstrated curiosity about
the functionality of the auditory and haptic prototype, this was
not evident with the visual display. Another factor that may
have influence this anomaly is the way the modalities present
the data to the participant’s. On some occasions participants
seemed to think that the haptic and audio had malfunctioned,
as the sound was inaudible or the vibrations were too weak
to feel. There was even occasions where participants differentiated between interacting with the prototype to gather data
and interacting to check the functionality – “I am not using
it I am just checking it.”, [DM, Haptic]. This was not the case
with the visual display, which displayed constant illumination
at all times. These themes exemplify aspects of experiencing
data that does not occur when perceiving visual representations. There is, however, one theme that is made of codes predominately retrieved from participants using the visual prototype. Throughout the transcribes there is 18 instances where
participant’s revealed feeling confused when interpreting the
representation and 11 of these are be attributed to the visual
modality. Participants also recalled becoming frustrated and annoyed with the prototype when they were unable to gain an
understanding of the data. The following statement illustrates
this point:
“I saw the numbers and I didn’t know what they meant, I didn’t
even know if high was something or low was something, so I was confused all the time, does it mean that high all the time means it was too
bad, I don’t know.” [AS, Visual].
The distribution of modalities in this theme is out of line with
the rest, as it is the only one that the visual modality accounts
for the majority of codes. This is compounded by the fact that
it is the only theme that could be identified as being negative.
By drawing attention to this issue I am not suggesting that visualizations have a higher propensity to cause confusion nor
am I saying the other modalities are free from fault in this respect. The reasons for this could be explained as participant’s
being aware of a misunderstanding with the visual display but
as the other modalities are more unusual, their confusion could
be masked by their enthusiasm to interpret data through such

8.3 evaluation

novel interfaces.
Lastly, let me draw attention to the distribution of visual
codes in Theme B: Making Sense verses Theme C: Making meaning (Table 13). Figure 43 shows that there are more occurrences
of meaning-making than sense-making with the visual modality. I already discussed how the interpretation of data first starts
with making sense and is followed by forming meaning from
the representation. The distribution of visual codes seems to
suggest that participants may skip the making sense phase and
rely much less on cues (as this is the more familiar and more
explicit modality).
The next representational modality that I focus on is auditory.
In particular I will address themes that this modality accounts
for a high majority of codes. Although the auditory modality is
responsible for the highest proportion of codes in eight of the
sixteen themes (D, E, G, J, K, M, N & P), I focus here of two
themes (Table 13, Theme K: Inner Reasoning & Theme P: Using
Instinct), as examples, and reason why this modality accounts
for such a high percentage.
I found fourteen instances (codes) where participant’s recounted
moments that involved reasoning about the data, on these occasions they spoke about this reasoning occurring inside of
them (Table 13, Theme K: Inner Reasoning). Participant’s specifically recalled this occurring either in their head, chest or hands.
When I examined the codes more closely I found that inner reasoning about haptic data representations was typically associated with the participants’ chest or hands. While one participant recalled this happening “behind my chest.” [DM, Haptic],
another explained that reasoning about the difference between
two haptic data representations happens – “in my hands and the
old one is inside me” [KP, Haptic]. Unlike these examples, the
location of inner reasoning with the auditor modality was described as being in their head. To illustrate this, TH was asked
to describe the moment he realised a data representations did
not match his expectation:
“it just felt not right, it felt different from what I thought
would happen, I had a sound in my head and it sounded different from what I though it should be.”, [TH, Audio].

255

256

delving below the surface

Inner reasoning about auditory data representations was also,
at times, accompanied by a voice. Participant’s recalled this
voice interjecting with comments about the data and also confirming when meaning had been gained from the data. The
following statement illustrates this process:
“it is like the voice in your head, yea it is like a person, it’s the voice
in my head saying ’that’s like the low sound’.”, [DME, Audio].
DME was then probed to recall further details about the voice
she was hearing at the time:
DME: (pause 2 secs stares into space) I don’t know cause I have never
really, like I have never put any thought, I have never really listened
to say does it sound like my voice, cause it has always been there.
Interviewer: OK and where is that voice in your head, could you.
DME: could I show you a point where it is? [interviewer: yes] yea yea,
it actually sits very much here (hold back of her head) [interviewer: ok]
in this section of my head. That is where it all happens.
The analysis of the transcripts revealed twelve instances where
participant’s talked about using instinct or personal experiences
to make sense or meaning from the data. The representational
modality in use in the majority of these occasions was the auditory modality (Audio: 9, Visual: 2, Haptic: 1). When recalling
these episodes it revealed participant’s found it particularly difficult to describe processes of insight generation and tended to
use phrases such as:
“I just know.”, [DME, Audio], “I just have to trust my instincts.”,
[CN, Audio], and “it happens so fast, it’s over in a second.”, [MC,
Audio].
Participant’s also commenting on not feeling like they were
thinking when interpreting the data representation, things just
happen without them being aware of it and they described this
in terms of not being in control of the judgement they make.
The following statement illustrates this:
“I didn’t think about it, so I just took it for granted that that was
actually like the sound that I had heard before and I was accepting of
that, that was it, that was like the low sound.”, [DME, Audio].

8.3 evaluation

Another participant echoed the sentiment of this statement
when asked to describe how he knew the real-time reading was
high:
“I am just gauging that it is higher, how do I gauge that it is higher?
that it is towards the higher end? am I don’t know, it just feels that
way to me, I don’t mean feel as in vibrate, I think it is just from life
experience being aware of the tone.”, [MC, Audio].
In this statement MC specifically acknowledges the role that
life experience plays in recognizing the differences or similarities between two sounds. He also speaks about it ’feeling that
way’, but is quick to clarify what he means by ’feeling’. Other
participant’s also used the term ’feeling’ as a way to describe
something happening but were unsure as to why or how it happened. The following extract is DME’s response to my question:
what happens when you are trying to compare it to a sound
that is in your memory?
“I just felt, it is kind of more of a feeling, because it is a more low
level, it is more relaxing when you hear it through your senses so it
didn’t cause me alarm, I don’t know what happens I just know, at the
time, I knew it was low, I felt it was low.”
Finally, let me address the distribution of codes extracted
from participant’s who used the haptic display. When analysing
the data (see yellow slices in Figure 43), I was drawn immediately to themes that have a high proportion of hapic codes as
well as those that had very few. If we look at Theme L (Memorizing), which I describe as accounts of remembering or memorizing data, participant’s using the haptic modality recalled the
vast majority of these moments (Audio: 1, Visual: 1, Haptic: 10).
A particular interesting aspect is revealed when the codes are
examined further. Although the hapic prototype represents the
data using vibro–tactile feedback, on some occasions, instead of
memorizing the vibrations, participant’s commented on focusing on the sound being emitted from the motors. When recalling how he focuses on auditory feedback instead of vibrations
from the prototype KP recalled:
“I think just because like the sound is the quickest and easiest way
for me to remember it, it was harder to remember what it felt like at

257

258

delving below the surface

high than what it sounded like at high.”, [KP, Haptic].
During the interviews, it proved to be very difficult task for
participants to recall how they memorize data representations.
In most cases it took multiple iterations and maintaining focus
on what the participant perceived to be a very short period
of time to reveal details about the processes involved. The following extract exemplifies the struggle with recalling such moments:
“I make a mental record of whatever I have, whatever mental value
I have is value A and then value B is the other. So whether the variable or parameter is sound or level of smell or whatever sense you are
using, I make a mental note of the first one and the second and then I
can recall. I then recall the first one and base the second one against
the first one, because the second one is more, is more present, its more
vivid in my imagination.”, [JC, Haptic].
As can be seen in this statement JC reveals that he makes
a “mental record or note” of the sound and labels it to recall it
later, however, the description is not as fine as I would have
wanted, so I probe JC to reiterate a number of more times to
reveal further details. Following three more iterations that took
just under 5-minutes JC begins to explain more about the process of memorizing haptic data representations:
“I had been drilling a wall the day before and that would have been,
in terms of haptic feedback, that would be, drilling into concrete, on a
scale of one to ten, it would be ten so very high. So I recall, I wasn’t
aware of this at the time, but now I have a mental bar chart or scale,
a barometer, a haptic barometer in my mind, so I am using that as a
scale of ten so I can place the data as I feel it on the barometer. So I
feel a very low, I suppose, like a phone vibration and I give it 3 on the
scale, so I am just memorizing the number 3 not really what I feel,
just the number.”
This extract provides a clearer description about how he memorizes haptic data, which is similar to the strategies, discussed
the earlier section: Using Spatial and Visual Cues. What is most
interesting about JC’s account is the complex and multi-layered
nature of the cognitive task involved in memorizing the data,
which involves: reliving past experiences (drilling), using objects (barometer, scales, phone) and converting sensations into

8.4 discussion of the two studies

numerical data. It should also be noted that JC acknowledged
that he was unaware of using such processes prior to being interviewed.

8.3.2.4

Recurrent Themes

I will now compare the results of this Elicitation study with
those of the Elicitation study described in Chapter 7. Although
the data representations used in the earlier study (Chapter 7)
comprised of static printed visualizations, compared to the dynamic interactive representations presented here, the findings
reveal some interesting similarities in how participant’s experienced both sets of representations. Four of the themes established in this study can be easily matched to themes from the
previous study. In both studies participant’s recalled moments
when then realised that they had formed some meaning from
the data (Table 13, Theme C: Meaning Making and Theme D:
Finding Meaning). Participants also spoke about having a sense
of fulfilment at the conclusion of their time using the prototypes and the data visualizations (Table 13, Theme I: Fulfilment
and Theme E: Fulfilment). Whether the data representations
were interactive or static participant’s recalled using previous
knowledge to held generate insight (Table 13, Theme M: Using
Previous Knowledge and Theme J: Using Previous Knowledge).
Lastly both sets of participants commented on how they made
sense of the data (Table 13, Theme B: Making Sense and Theme
G: Sense of Understanding), these themes, however, are not as
close as the previous ones. In Chapter 7 we associated making
sense with gaining an understanding, however, the study we
present here has shed new light on this and shows that generating insight is a iterative process that involves numerous phases
with each one dependent on the previous to gain a full understanding of data.
8.4

discussion of the two studies

I divide the discussion of findings into two sections. I first address issues related to the tangible nature of the prototypes
and I discuss the design outcomes of the findings by pointing
toward possible use scenarios for tangible data representations.
I then discuss what I have learned about the affect representational modality has on people’s experience of data. In doing

259

260

delving below the surface

this collate and discuss the findings of the two studies (RepGrid
and Elicitation) to show what has been learned from applying
a method to explore the meaning participants attribute to the
their interaction with the prototypes and then using a method
to probe deep into people’s experience with prototypes.
8.4.1

Tangible Interfaces

Following the analysis of the studies there seems to be evidence
to show that using tangibles to monitor and represent data
stimulates debate about the data source. I provided our participant’s with prototypes that can be shared within a group
and it would seem that these mediated and focused the conversation around the data. While there was clear evidence of
this during the focus group sessions, the Elicitation interview
transcripts also support this. Although the primary aim of the
Elicitation interviews was to focus on an episode when knowledge or meaning was formed from the participant’s interaction
with the data representation, the transcripts revealed insight
about how people share their understanding of the representation with others. On occasions participants talked about being
eager to tell others about the latest reading and to “warn” them
that the air was unhealthy. In the following extract AS is probed
about how she knows that the levels are unhealthy:
AS: I just feel that what I am hearing is not good for me
Interviewer: How do you know?
AS: Well it is not just bad for me, it’s bad for everyone
Interviewer: For everyone?
AS: Yes for the rest in the room, it is their air as well, so I should tell
them about it
Interviewer: How do you tell them? If you go back to the time when
you realised that you should “tell them”, how do you realise you
should tell them?
AS: (pause 3 seconds) I am looking at the cube, the sound is in my
head and I say to myself “jezz, this is not good, let’s tell Margaret
(work colleague) about it”
Interviewer: and what do you do next?
AS: I go over, with the cube to talk to her about it
In the following moments of the interview AS talked about
her exchange with Margaret, explaining that she used the cube
to demonstrate the present CO2 levels. There were also occa-

8.4 discussion of the two studies

sions when participants spoke about confirming, or wanting to
confirm the real-time levels with others who shared the space.
I believe that portability is not the only factor here, the size of
the prototypes also allowed them to be handed over and moved
easily. In Hornecker and Buur’s framework [111], they purport
that tangible user interfaces support aspects such as social interaction. Supporting the social aspects of data representation is
especially important today, as their purpose has moved beyond
just assisting domain experts with analytical tasks, but are now
frequently used in casual contexts such as museums, libraries
or at home. I believe the findings show that tangible interaction
combined with data representation can play an important role
in future developments of tools for data exploration in casual
contexts.
The tangible prototypes are different from how ambient data
is normally monitored and represented. Typically, wall mounted
sensors and displays are used to sample and represent data
from a fixed point. The use of a portable device allows people
to sample and represent the air space around them. I found that
this creates a sense for the user that the readings are personal
to them. I believe this may impact on how the user is affected
by the data, which may in-turn cause them to act more quickly
in a given situation, such as opening a window when the IAQ
drops.

8.4.2

Representational Modalities

The studies presented in this chapter were conducted to gain a
deep understanding of how people experience data when it is
represented by tangible interfaces through three different types
of representational modalities. The first study I presented used
the repertory grid technique in form of a focus group session,
to compare the three design probes by revealing participant’s
agreed description of each. The second study employed the Elicitation Interview technique to shed light on the cognitive processes people use when perceiving and interpreting the data
represented by the same prototypes. The rationale for running
these studies consecutively was that it allowed me to first reveal people’s general impression of the different modalities before eliciting deeper insight that the participant’s may or may
not have been aware of at the time of using the prototypes.

261

262

delving below the surface

I should note that the purpose of running these two studies
was not to compare the methodologies, instead I was interested
what these methods, conducted one–after–another, would reveal about people’s experience of data representation. I should
also acknowledge that the set-up of these studies was quite
different, in so much as the RepGrid study only allowed participants an hour to familiarise themselves with the prototypes,
while the participants of the Elicitation study had one week to
use the prototypes. The discrepancy in time allowed with the
prototypes may also have had an impact on the findings. For
instance, the findings of Elicitation study show that the visual
modality caused a high level of confusion (compared to the
other modalities). However, this was not apparent in the RepGrid study, in fact, on the contrary, the participants described
the visual modality as being “easy to interpret”. This may indicate that confusion may start to become prominent after prolonged use of the visual modality and while the haptic and auditory modality were initially “difficult to interpret”, once the
participants became more familiar with them they developed
personal strategies to help with the interpretation of the data,
such as the use of visual and spatial cues.
In the sections above I discussed the findings of each study
separately, I now zoom out to reflect on what both findings
together tells us about people’s experience of the three different representational modalities. When examining the results of
both studies it becomes apparent that the haptic and auditory
representational modalities are experienced in a very similar
manner. The RepGrid reveals ten clear similarities and this is
supported distribution of codes established during the Elicitation study. While these two modalities have strong connections,
both are noticeably different from the visual modality. Both the
RepGrid and the codes attributed to the visual modality during the Elicitation interviews show a marked contrast from the
other modalities.
During the studies participants consistently spoke about their
difficulty in recognising subtle changes in the haptic and auditory representation, whereas small changes were immediately
noticed in the visual interface. While some confusion was caused
by becoming aware of minor changes (using the visual prototype) but not understanding the implications, I believe that
this reveals a characteristic of the auditory and haptic modali-

8.4 discussion of the two studies

ties that warrants further investigation. It could be argued that
these modalities may be better suited to representing non-critical
ambient data (such as IAQ), where minor changes have no
great impact. The visual modality may, however, be more appropriate for representing critical data, such as carbon monoxide,
where even small changes can be dangerous and life threatening.
An aspect of people’s experience of data that was also highlighted in both studies was the role of the body. In the RepGrid
study the participant recognised the importance of the hands
and fingers when interpreting and forming meaning from haptic data representations. They also alluded to the body when
using the auditory representation by talking about raising the
prototype towards their ear to enhance the perception of the
representation. The Elicitation interviews allowed me to gather
further details about the body, the findings show that all the
participant’s spoke about their body when recalling their experience with the prototypes. Interestingly, although all the prototypes required tangible interaction to trigger the prototype to
represent the data, both studies show that the haptic and auditory modality seemed to heighten this awareness, as there were
very little references to the body when the participant’s used
the visual modality. While it would be expected that the haptic modality and to a lesser degree with the auditory modality,
would increase awareness of the body, this may not be the case
for the auditory modality. Nonetheless, there were many occasions where the role of the body was discussed that did not
involve feeling sensations through their hands. These include
being aware of their body position (standing, sitting etc.) or being aware of movement, such as walking. While these are very
earlier findings and do require further investigations, they may
point toward the haptic and auditory modality offering a more
holistic human experience of data that is difficult to achieve
when perceiving or interpreting just with our eyes.
Another aspect of people’s experience with the modalities
that is highlighted in the results of the studies is the complex
processes involved in interpreting the data. The RepGrid revealed details about the difficulties associated with interpreting data, how some modalities struggle to represent a wide
range of data points, some evoke memories of past events, some
are perceived as playful while others are more serious, logi-

263

delving below the surface

cal and informative. The RepGrid also shows how the visual
modality is considered as being very accurate, unlike the other
two, which make the perception of subtle changes very difficult. Other difficulties highlighted during the Elicitation study
include (1) moments of confusion, (2) difficulties in memorising and (3) distractions caused by ambient noise. All of these
issues make the process of interpreting data difficult, however,
the studies also revealed the processes people employ to negate
these issues. The RepGrid shows how people evoke memories
of past events to help interpret the data, especially with the
haptic and auditory modality. The results also show how people combine or switch between modalities when two are available i.e. haptic modality. The Elicitation study, however, offered
far more insight into the process people employ during moments of data interpretation. Alongside the evocation of past
events and relying on instinct, which was also evident during the RepGrid study, the interview transcripts revealed moments where participant’s utilized mental cues to make sense
of the data. These processes involved translating sounds and
sensations into objects and images and placing these along an
imagined line to judge the differences between two or more
representations. In most cases the participant’s were unaware
of these cognitive processes until they recalled them during
the interview. The Elicitation interviews also revealed details
about the phases involved in interpreting data representations.
They show how people first engage in a process that allows
them to make sense of the data, by seeking patterns or correlations. Once these have been resolved the next phase involves
attributing meaning to what they have found. The processes involved in data interpretation is vastly under-explored, and is
overlooked by a series of studies that have sought to explore
data insight (cf [207][255]). I believe that research is needed in
this area, not just to investigate the type of insight generated
by data representations but to look more closely at how people
generate data insight.

chapter summary

In this chapter I presented an experiment that involved the creation of three design probes (prototypes) and the evaluation of
these using the RepGrid technique, followed by a series of Elicitation interviews. The aim here was to conduct a series of ex-

8.5 chapter summary

periments that allows for the capture of accounts of experience
at finer levels of granularity. Starting first with a RepGrid study,
this enabled me to better understand how people interpret data
in different modalities, by analysing the meaning structures
that they apply to each prototype. I found that the auditory
and haptic are generally perceived as being similar to each
other, but, different from the visual modality. This study also
revealed interesting insight about the modalities, such as peoples awareness of the tangible properties of the haptic modality,
the capacity of the auditory and haptic modality to evoke memories of past events and the recognition that the visual modality
requires prior knowledge but the other two modalities can be
instinctively interpreted. The Elicitation Interview study was
conducted to reveal even deeper insight about how representational modality affects people’s experience of data. The results
of this study revealed insight about the nuances of data interpretation that have yet to be highlighted in other studies. These
include evidence that suggest the process of interpretation is
a multi-step process (from making sense to making meaning),
the use of metal cues (spatial and visual) to help interpret the
representation, and the awareness of the body (position and
proximity) when interpreting non-visual representations.
In presenting these studies I conclude the experiments I conducted during my PhD. I now move towards summarising the
previous chapters, formulating my key contributions and presenting the known limitations and unanswered questions. All
of this is done in the next chapter.

Part III
REFLECTION
I began this thesis with the aim of trying to better understand the way people experience data and how
representational modality affects this experience. I
now conclude this exploration by revisiting the major points and research questions presented in this
thesis. In the following, I summarise what I have
learned and what does this mean for the study and
design of future data representations - in the context of HCI and neighbouring fields. I also draw together the key findings from the experiments presented in earlier chapters and reveal patterns that
appear across these studies. In the introduction I presented the three connected questions that this thesis
sought to answer: How do people experience data, what
influence does representation modality have on this experience, and how does it affect the way meaning is formed
by the audience? Overtime, other questions emerged
from my research, and while these did not alter the
focus of my research, they did exposed new areas
that merited further examination and investigation.
In the next chapter I discuss the manifestation of
these investigations, by presenting the key contributions I claim to have made in this thesis. I divide
and discuss these contributions under the following
categories: theoretical, methodological, design, empirical. Before I conclude, I addressed two important
aspects of my thesis, firstly the limitations of my research and the questions that remain unanswered,
which I believe will be valuable inspiration for future researchers.

summary

The main body of this thesis is divided into two parts. In part
one, I laid out the theoretical and design foundations of my research, while part two was dedicated to introducing my methodological approach and presenting a series of experiments that
revealed insight into peoples experience with data. In the following I summarise the previous chapters, starting first with
those from Part One, before dealing with the final three chapters in Part Two.
In the beginning of this thesis, I introduced phenomenology as underpinning the philosophical and methodological approach to my work. Following an overview of the genesis of
this philosophical tradition, I discussed key terminology and
concepts from four phenomenologists: Edmund Husserl, Martin Heidegger, Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Don Ihde. Through
this, I showed how Husserls’ theory of intentionality, which
he developed from the earlier thoughts of Franz Brentano, describes the way we experience the world as being actional (involves an action) and referential (refers to something external).
I then discussed two Heideggerian ideas, including his conception of how we use equipment and how we conceive temporality.
Heidegger argues that people encounter the equipment of our
lives as either ready-to-hand (when we use it), or present-at-hand
(when we stare at it but don’t use it). In describing Heidegger’s
thoughts on temporality, I explained how we perceive the three
phases of temporality in an authentic and an inauthentic mode.
In this chapter I also showed how the work of Maurice Merleau Ponty has had a pronounced influence on HCI and other
fields of computer science since the 1960’s, and his ideas are
still highly relevant today. Specific research communities, such
as TEI, regularly incorporate his ideas and concepts into contemporary research. Merleau-Ponty focused his life’s work on
understanding and describing the role of the human body in
perception. The two key ideas that closely relate to my lines

269

270

thesis summary

of enquiry are: The Body Schema and Maximum Grip. I showed
how the body schema is the medium through which we experience the world, while maximum grip relates to the relationship between our body and the object of our intention. These
objects solicit our bodies to acquire the optimal position to
best perceive the object. The final concept that I introduced
in Chapter 2 was Don Ihde’s Human-Technology Relations. This
concept refers to the way we technology mediates our experience of the world and it incorporates four types of relations:
Background, Embodiment, Hermeneutic, and Alterity. In concluding this chapter I illustrated how phenomenology has influenced HCI research. Starting with the work of Winograd and
Flores [317], I transcended the embodied turn in HCI to discuss influential contributions from notably researchers such as
Dag Svanœs [276][277] [278], Paul Dourish [52], Toni Robertson [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] and others.
Once I had introduced the phenomenological tradition, I moved
over to two other central aspects of my research: data representation and evaluation. In Chapter 3, I first presented a brief
history of data representation, focusing at times on important
milestones that have influenced the trajectory of the field. Although this review showed the primary modality used to represent data today still remains visual, I illustrated a recent surge
in research on other modalities such as physical, auditory, olfactory and gustatory. As the primary focus of my research
is to understand how people experience data representation,
in this chapter I also reviewed approaches and methodologies
that are commonly used to gather accounts of experience. I focused on outlining the strengths and limitations of methods,
such as, observational studies, diary studies, questionnaires,
the think-aloud protocol, and interviews. While these methods
have been relatively successful at revealing issues related to the
user-experience of systems, it became clear to me that I would
have to incorporate other methods, some of which have rarely
been applied in the context of HCI, to allow for the capture of
precise accounts of experience.
In Chapter 4, I sought to bridge the gap between theory and
design. To accomplish this, I conducted an experiment, which
incorporated a design exercise and a user study. The artefacts
introduced here were designed specifically for a public Space
Observatory, with the aim of representing scientific data for ca-

9.1 summary

sual visitors in a natural manner. Over the course of one week
I deployed two prototypes in the Observatory, observed them
in use and interviewed visitors about their experience of using
these prototypes. Using the data gathered, I analysed the prototypes through the prism of the phenomenological concepts that
I introduced in ??. This examination not only provided me with
a better understanding on how visitors experienced the prototypes but also helped me comprehend the relationship between
philosophical phenomenology and the experience of data representation.
The final chapter in part one of this thesis is dedicated to surveying the state-of-the-art in data representation. In particular I
focused on defining and analysing data representations that require more than one sensory channel to fully interpret the data.
As part of this work I defined, for the first time, multisensory
data representations as:
A class of data representation that have a clear intent to reveal insight
by encoding data in more than one representational modality and require at least two sensory channels to fully interpret and understand
the data.
Using this definition, I collected and analysed 154 examples,
and established a design space, which incorporates three dimensions: use of modalities, representation intent, and humandata relations. Derived from the analysis of the design space, I
addressed key research issues, including: questioning the value
added by expanding the sensory channels required to interpret
a data representation. I also discussed issues from the users
perspective and explored the boundaries between representation and art. I concluded the discussion by highlighting underexplored areas and future challenges and then presented five
key recommendations aimed at providing practical guidance
to other researchers and practitioners who wish to study and
create multi-sensory data representations.
Part Two of this thesis is focused on introducing two evaluation methodologies that I employed in this thesis while also presenting a series of experiments, which were aimed at gathering
accounts of experience with data representations and comparing how representational modality affects people’s experience
of data. As previously stated, my review of methods commonly

271

272

thesis summary

used to examine people’s experience of systems highlighted certain limitations, including the introducing of personal bias and
post-hoc rationalization, the high level of effort and commitment required by the participant and researcher, and the difficulty in obtaining in-depth and precise accounts (see Table 2,
Chapter 3). To overcome these difficulties I sought to incorporate and adapt methodologies that have rarely been used in the
context of HCI or for the purpose of evaluating data representations. In Chapter 6, I presented the Repertory Grid Technique
(RepGrid) as a useful method for collecting data on how people construe their experience of objects, people or events. Although this method has been used in HCI since the 1980’s, I
discovered some limitations with the traditional application of
the technique, especially when following a phenomenological
approach (as is my case). The main issues relate to the type
of data that is gathered and the time and effort required to
collect this data. To overcome these concerns I formulated and
described a new procedure for the application of the RepGrid
technique, which involved blending it with a focus group session and analysing the data using a qualitative approach. In
this chapter I also validated this approach by presenting a sideby-side experiment, which incorporated a traditional application of the technique, followed by a study that incorporated my
adaptions. The methodological findings here show not only is
the adaptions more efficient to run, but it also allows for the
capture of rich data (participants remarks) that is typically overlooked or lost when employing traditional procedures. While
this adaption resulted in facilitating the capture of rich design
relevant information, I remained focused on gathering deeper
insight and more precise accounts of people’s experience. To accomplish this I introduced the Elicitation Interview technique,
which apart form some notably examples (cf. [162] [209]) has
rarely been used in the context of HCI and has never been used
to explore people’s experience of data. I dedicated Chapter 7
to introducing this technique, describing the key characteristics
of the technique, illustrating how it can be applied in different
contexts and describing the types of insights it can support.
As well as introducing methodologies in Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 , I also presented a series of studies, which employed
these methods to explore people’s experience of data representation, while also, investigating the role representation modality plays in this process. The aim of the experiment described

9.1 summary

in Chapter 8 was similar, but incorporated two studies (RepGrid and Elicitation Interviews), which were conducted consecutively, but each used the same set of prototypes to examine
the phenomenon of data experience at finer levels of granularity. The findings of all these studies reveal interesting aspects
about how people experience, interpret and perceive data representations. For instance, in Chapter 6, I showed how the haptic
modality can be difficult to interpret but the process of interpretation happens instinctually. In Chapter 7, I discovered that
when people begin to interpret data visualizations they rely
heavily on visual variables to start the process, they also seek
personal connections with the data source and they seek to find
meaning beyond the data, which sometimes results in the manifestation of vivid (mental) images. Finally, in Chapter 8 the findings of the two studies reveal aspects such as: the haptic and
auditory modality evoke memories of past experiences, the use
of mental cues (spatial and visual) to help interpret the data,
and there seems to be evidence that data interpretation is a two
step process, which involves first making sense of the representation before meaning is formed.
These discrete findings go some way to build a picture of
how we experience data; however, if we zoom out, and look
at the findings from all five studies together we can get more
holistic appreciation of about the structure of this experience.
When I placed the findings from the studies side-by-side some
similarities and patterns emerged, these relate to: (1) the body,
(2) issues with interpretation, (3) relying on instinct, (4) multimodality, and (5) referencing the lifeworld.
the body In Chapter 6, observations during the study revealed how participants were more active - moving from one
position to another – when engaging with the auditory and
haptic modality. While the same type of movement was not observed in the other studies, the findings show that there was
a heightened sense of awareness of ones body position, again
with the auditory and haptic modality. In Chapter 8, I showed
that grasping the haptic interface in different ways affected the
perception of the representation and also participants tended to
speak more about their body position when recalling their experience with the auditory and haptic prototype. This insight
echoes Merleau-Ponty’s notion of the maximum grip (outlined
in ??), in so much as objects tend to solicit us to optimise our

273

274

thesis summary

position to enhance our perception when interacting with. It
also may encourage designers of future sonifications and physicalizations to facilitate movement and mobility around these
types of representations to allow for a more holistic and natural perception of the data.

issues with interpretation The RepGrid study represented in Chapter 6 revealed how participants had difficulty
interpreting the data represented by the haptic and auditory
modality. They also described the auditory modality as being
abstract. The results of the RepGrid study in Chapter 8 echoed
these findings. The participants who took part in this study
also described these modalities as being difficult to interpret
and described the representations as ambiguous. In both studies participants agreed that the visual modality was not abstract
or ambiguous, instead they chose word, such as, scientific, intellectual, practical, precise, and logical to describe their experience of this modality. These findings seem to suggest the type
of scenario that the various modalities are best suited to. For
instance, the visual modality may be better at representing critical data and supporting work-related activities, whereas the
auditory and haptic modalities may be more appropriate for
non-critical data in casual scenarios, where the type of data insight revealed by the representation is more open-ended.

relying on instinct The findings in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 both indicate that participant’s consider the interpretation
of visualizations as an intellectual activity, which requires some
level of training or education to complete. Whereas, the process
of interpreting haptic and auditory representations is more instinctual and relies on life experience to generate meaning from
these types of representations. The Elicitation study (Chapter 8)
shed some light on the cognitive processes used to form meaning from the haptic and auditory modality. These involved, for
instance, the use of spatial and visual cues to help interpret
the difference between two representations. A number of participants recalled seeing mental images of shapes, colours and
objects and placing these on a line or graph, then using the
proximity between the elements to understand the differences
between the two representations, thus using their instinct of
spatial awareness to interrogate the difference. Knowing that

9.1 summary

people rely on instinct over knowledge to interpret non-visual
representations is something that system designers should be
aware of and adds more weigh to the argument that these types
of representations are better suited to casual scenarios, such as
museums, public spaces, libraries etc.

multimodality In Chapter 5, I proposed a design space
for multisensory data representation, which addressed, in part,
issues related to the representation of data through more than
one modality. In the findings of studies presented in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 issues related to multimodal representations also appeared. In particular these related to the experience people had with the haptic representation. When designing these prototypes, my original intention was to represent
the data through vibro-tactile feedback (knocking and vibration). However, the mechanics used to generate the vibrations
also resulted in sounds being emitted from the prototypes. This
resulted in confusion with some participants, as the intensity
of the sound was perceived as being different (stronger) to the
knocking and vibration. This issue is of most concern to designers of multimodal representations, where two different modalities are used to represent the same data, whereas with crossmodal representations two modalities are used to represent different data sets in the same interface. In the case of multimodal
representations it is important that the two modalities are of
equal intensity so as to not cause confusion. While I acknowledge that this may be difficult to achieve, overlooking this issue
may result in misinterpretation and/or confusion.

referencing the lifeworld The findings of the studies
presented in Chapter 6, Chapter 7, and Chapter 8 all show evidence of participants referencing events, objects, people and
past experiences that were triggered during the interpretation
of the data representations. In Chapter 6, I noted a tendency
for participants to use real-world analogies when interpreting
the representational modalities, these included, for instance, a
domestic appliance (haptic modality), and a rainbow (visual
modality). In the Elicitation study presented in Chapter 7, participants also referenced the lifeworld, but this time it related
to finding personal connections with the data visualization. I
found that they seek these connections to reaffirm their un-

275

276

thesis summary

derstanding of the presented information, to contextualize the
information, and to critically contemplate about presented approaches and facts. This phenomenon also appeared in the studies presented in Chapter 8, however, here the haptic and auditory seemed to be the modalities that evoked memories of past
events and objects, whereas the visual modality did not. While
I am not entirely sure how designers can leverage this knowledge, it does reveal insight into what people think about when
interpreting data representation, no matter what modalities are
in use.
9.2

contributions

In this section I will present the contributions I claim to have
made in this thesis. To help make sense of these, I divide them
into four categories: theoretical, methodological, empirical, and
design (see Figure 44). In the following I discuss each one separately.

Figure 44: Thesis contributions, which includes the categories (theoretical, design, empirical, methodological), the type, and
chapter where each contribution is described.

9.2.1

Theoretical contribution

At the commencement of my PhD I decided to take a phenomenological approach to my research. I choose this not only
because I wanted to explore people’s lived experience of data
representation, but I also sought to bracket all of the presupposition that I have acquired about data representation over
the years. When I searched the literature for related work, the
only previous research I could find related to empirical studies on evaluating user-experience (cf. [37]). There had been no

9.2 contributions

research conducted which attempted to describe how people
experience data representation, including, how this experience
unfolds over time or specific episodes during this experience
i.e. formation of insight/meaning. I claim that this thesis has
gone some way to fill this gap by providing the reader with
rich, detailed and precise accounts of experiencing data. I have
also addressed, for the first time, how representational modality affects this experience. As well as using phenomenology as
a basis for my research approach, I have also incorporated concepts, notions, and ideas from philosophical phenomenology to
provide a better understanding on how we experience data.
The theoretical contribution of this thesis also includes establishing the design space for multisensory data representations
(see Chapter 5). The survey I conducted as part of the design
space exploration is the first time that data representations from
a wide range of disciplines, spread over a long period of time,
have been drawn together and analysed under the same criteria and included 154 examples of publications, art installations
and consumer devises from a range of domains, including the
natural sciences, architecture, design, and contemporary art. I
claim that this research has not only contributed to the field
of HCI, but other domains that design and study data representation. It bridges the gap between theoretical concerns and
the practicalities of design, and provides practitioners with an
overview of the design possibilities, as well as informing to researchers about present and future research challenges when
representing data with and beyond the visual paradigm.
9.2.2

Methodological contribution

In the early stages of my PhD I sough out methodologies that
would allow me to follow a phenomenological approach by
capturing rich accounts of people’s lived experiences. When
I commenced this search I surveyed methodologies that have
been proven over the years and were commonly used in HCI. I
soon discovered that all of these methods had limitations and
would not be suitable in the context of my research. Thus, I extended my search to include methods that are not commonly
used or wrote about in the context of HCI. From this two methods emerged: The Repertory Grid technique and The Elicitation
Interview technique.

277

278

thesis summary

Although the Repertory Grid technique has been used in HCI
since the 1980’s, the contribution that I claim here relates to an
adaptation I made to the typical application of the technique.
In Chapter 6 I described how the Repertory Grid technique,
blended with a focus group session allows for the efficient capture and analysis of rich design relevant information. There
have been some sporadic attempts to conduct parts of a Repertory Grid study in groups (cf. [307] [86] [227] [187] [261] [5],
however, the adaption I present in this thesis is first time that
all phases of the Repertory Grid technique were conducted in
a group setting. I also validated this adaption by conducting
a side-by-side study that compared the traditional application
against my adaption. I am not hesitant in claiming that this
adaptation will increase the use of Repertory Grid studies in
HCI and neighbouring fields, as some one of the most cited obstacles that hinders the use of the Repertory Grid technique is
the time, effort and commitment required by the researcher and
participant when carrying out a typical Repertory Grid study.
The contribution that this adaption also makes relates to the
type of data collected (rich qualitative data) and the method of
analysis (discourse analysis).
While the Repertory Grid technique has a long tradition of
use in HCI research, the use of the Elicitation Interview technique is far less common. In Chapter 7, I introduced, and for
the first time in the context of HCI, described the key characteristics of this interview technique and exemplify how it can be
applied to evaluate static data representations. The study I described in this chapter illustrates what types of insight this technique can bring to the fore, and also presented general evaluation scenarios where the Elicitation Interview technique may be
beneficial. One of the valuable characteristics of this interview
technique is that it facilitates the interviewee to re-call a past
experience in high levels of detail, and it makes them aware
of the pre-reflective dimension of this experience. So instead of
the interviewer asking direct questions about a past event (such
as with traditional interviews), the interviewer guides the participant back to the original experience to help them re-call it
as if it is happening now. One of values that I see in this for
HCI researchers is that instead of formulating pre-conceived
questions when interviewing participants about their interaction with a system, the Elicitation technique can reveal aspects

9.2 contributions

about this interaction that the participant may not have even
aware of when the interaction took place.
9.2.3

Design contribution

The design contribution that I claim relates, in part, to the prototypes designed, developed, and presented in this thesis (see
Figure 45). All of the artefacts I produced were designed for
a specific purpose, in the case of H3 and the solar radiation
dowsing rod (described in Chapter 4), these were created for
casual visitors to a space museum to allow them to experience
data that is typically only used for scientific discovery. The purpose of designing and producing a physicalization of emigration data from Ireland was to allow me to explore the practise
of physical representations of data. This artefact is one from a
series of ten physicalizations created to tell the story of Irelands’
past through the physical representations. Each representation
represents different data sets, including the economic, social
and cultural, by encoding the data into the form of the object,
thus allowing people to perceive the data through touch.

Figure 45: a: H3 , b: The Solar Radiation Dowsing Rod, c: CO2 cubes,
d: Emigration from Ireland 1987-2013.

The contribution to design also relates to the approach I took
in the studies presented in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8. I describe
the artefacts created using this approach as Design Probes. Although this approach is similar to research through design, it

279

280

thesis summary

is unique in so much as it doesn’t involve an iterative process, which is integral to research through design. An iterative
process involves designing a series of artefacts consecutively,
where improvements are made in new designs based on the
design knowledge gained from studying previous versions. I
also consider it to be close in intent to Technology Probes [115],
however, instead of studying the use of one artefact (which is
the procedure followed with technology probes), I create design multiple artefacts that possess similar design features but
differ in one aspect (e.g. representational modality). This allows
researchers to focus the evaluation precisely on this design feature - in my case this was representational modality.
9.2.4

Empirical contribution

The easiest and most obvious way to summarize the empirical contributions of this thesis is to point to the summary of
findings presented already in this chapter. In the three chapters
that make up Part Two of this thesis, I presented the findings
of four separate studies. Then, in this chapter, I summarised
these findings and teased out patterns that appear across these
studies. The findings I present in this thesis not only provide
a rich account of people’s conscious and pre-reflective experience of data visualizations (Chapter 7), but this is bookended
with two studies that explore, in fine detail, how representational modality affects the way we perceive, interpret, analyse
and experience data. I do not believe that I am over-reaching
when claiming that the empirical findings, on their own, or
combined with one another, go far beyond research that has
been published on data experience to date.
9.3

limitations

In this section, I acknowledge and address the limitations of
this work, both in its methods, procedures and findings. While
I have already acknowledged limitations in the studies carried
out in proceeding chapters, in the following I describe more
general limitations, which have an impact on more than one
aspect of this work.
To begin with, one of the objectives of the studies presented
in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 was to explore how representational
modality affects people’s experience of data. In these studies I

9.3 limitations

limited the modalities to three (haptic, auditory and visual). I
acknowledge these modalities do not reflect the full range of
possibilities, for instance, olfactory and gustatory are omitted.
However, the rationale for limiting both studies to three was
firstly due to technical issues related to producing and controlling odour and taste and also I sought to provide examples of
the most commonly used representational modalities.
Also, in relation to the three RepGrid studies described in
Chapter 6 and Chapter 8, in all cases the sample was quite a
homogeneous one. All participants have extremely similar social and educational backgrounds; they are of all the same ethnicity and they fall within a relatively narrow age group (19-36
years). There are two reasons for choosing a convenience sample for these studies, firstly, as I work as a lecture in a third
level institution, I had easy access to students who are, in most
cases, more open to participating in studies than working professionals. Also, due to the nature of the adaptation I made to
the RepGrid technique, which involved a focus group session,
I sought to conduct the studies with groups who were already
familiar with each other and were used to speaking aloud in
the group.
In an earlier section, I claim the adaptation of the RepGrid
procedure and the introduction of the Elicitation Interview technique as two key methodological contributions of this work.
That being so, I also acknowledge that incorporating methodologies, which I had relatively little exposure to, or experience
using, before my PhD may have limited the experiments presented in this thesis. As an example, I stated in Chapter 7 that
practising using the Elicitation Interview technique is one of
the most important aspects when learning to apply it correctly,
and although I endeavoured to carry out as many practise interviews as possible I still believe that I am improving, even after
completing two formal studies. When I compare the series of
interviews completed and described in Chapter 8, I believe that
they are an improvement on those described in Chapter 7. The
reason for this relates to a key characteristic of the technique
– the ability of the researcher to attain and maintain a state of
evocation in the participant, which I found much easier to do
in the second application of the technique. The experience I
had with the RepGrid studies is similar. Although I had some
prior experience facilitating focus group sessions, when these

281

282

thesis summary

are combined with the procedures of the RepGrid technique it
took sometime before I was entirely comfortable and pleased
with the outcomes.
Another limitation that I acknowledge, which was also alluded to in the contributions of this work, relates to the data
gathered when using the RepGrid and Elicitation Interview
technique. In both cases this data is extremely rich and abundant, so much so that much of it ended up being removed
from further analysis mainly due to time restrictions. I was also
concerned with highlighting the most revealing insight gathered during these studies, which meant prioritising these over
other revelations that may be seen by others as equally valuable and insightful. While this is a common occurrence when
employing many qualitative methodologies, it is important to
acknowledge it as being a limitation that may in some cases, if
the researcher is not rigorous or objective, skew the results of a
study. In my case, I relied on independent oversight from my
supervisor when filtering the data down to a manageable size.
Finally let me address the issue of generalizability. The question of generalizability arises in my case due to the size and
homogeneity of the samples used in the studies. In this context,
I do not argue for or purport to have achieved what Mason calls
an “empirical generalisation of findings” [174, p.195], which is
based on a generalisation or extrapolation from one population
or sample to another. Instead, I sough to follow a process that
would allow me gather accounts of lived experiences with data
and to use these to formulated a better understanding of what
happens when people interpret data representations. I do not
claim to have a better understanding of one population over
another, I merely present a body of work that describes the
experience a collection of volunteers had when I asked to use
various data representations under different conditions.
9.4

open questions

Over the course of my PhD three connected questions remained
central to the focus of my research: How do people experience
data, what influence does representation modality have on this experience, and how does it affect the way meaning is formed by the audience? When exploring answers to these questions other questions emerged, such as, for instance, How do we study people’s
experience of data? While I believe these and other pertinent

9.4 open questions

questions have been answered in the proceeding chapters, some
questions remain unanswered and I address these in the following paragraphs.
I already discussed the choice and range of modalities as being a limitation in this work and I provided some rationale
for the decisions I made. Because of this, there are research
questions related to representational modality that require further exploration. First of all, I have shown how representational
modality affects the way we perceive and interpret data, but
only in regards to three modalities, it remain unclear what affect other representational modalities, such as olfactory and
gustatory have on the perception, interpretation and overall experience of data. Another aspect of representational modality
that was not fully addressed in this work was the notion of
representational variables. For instance, in the second RepGrid
study described in Chapter 6, I used the colour variable to represent the data, but in other studies I used shape (BarGraph
(also in Chapter 6) and numbers (Chapter 8), the same was
true for the haptic modality (knocking: Chapter 6, vibration:
Chapter 6 and Chapter 8). The only modality that remained
consistent across all studies was the auditory modality, which
used the frequency of sounds to represent the data. If time had
permitted I would have liked to incorporate more than one variable for each modality, to study, not only the affect of representational modalities, but also how the variables for each modality influences people’s experience of data. With this said, I believe further research needs to be completed before we can fully
examine the role variables play in the experience of data. This
relates to the study and formalisation of variables beyond the
visual modality. I noted in Chapter 5 that visual variables have
been studied and confirmed since first formulated by Jaques
Bertin [13]. However, apart from some notably exceptions [146]
[291] [124] very little has been achieved with the other modalities. A concerted effort is required to formulate and confirm a
list of variables for the auditory, kinaesthetic, gustatory, and olfactory modalities. Until then it remains difficult for the wider
research community to develop and share knowledge on the
role they play when experiencing data.
On a similar note, a question that emerged from the findings
of studies presented in Chapter 6 and Chapter 8 relates to the
perceptual impact of different modalities. I discovered that par-

283

284

thesis summary

ticipants were confused by perceived differences in sounds and
vibrations emitted from haptic representation. It would be interesting to study the simultaneous perception of two different
modalities, with the aim of finding direct relationships between
the two. For instance, if a data point were represented through
the visual modality using the colour ’orange’, what would be
the equivalent representation when using the haptic or auditory modality?

Figure 46: Life Don’t Mean A Thing If It Ain’t Got That Swing, with
permission from James Pockson

In Chapter 5, I presented a relatively new venture in data representation that involves encoding data, not through the variables of representational modalities, but instead through the
performance, affordance and experience of the representation.
I presented a selection of examples that included a swing installation (see Figure 46), which encodes data in the physical
properties of the swing i.e. the length of rope, the height of the
seat etc. In turn, participants perceive and interpret the data
through the experience of swinging on the swing. As this departure of data representation is new, there have been no studies,
that I am aware of, which has investigated this form of representation. As this area grows, it seems that there may be some
value to be gained in examining people’s experience of experi-

encing data.
In the introduction of this thesis I outlined the primary design approach that I followed throughout my research. This
involved designing a series of design probes, which are similar apart form one design feature. Due to the nature of this
approach the type of artefacts I created were relatively simple and streamlined. A question that remains unanswered for
now is how would people respond if they encountered richer
data representations, which incorporated more complex interactions. Up until now, studies that have empirically examined
non-traditional modalities, such as sound [183], haptics [29]
and touch [124] have all used relatively simple interfaces, much
like those I introduced in this thesis. However, as we gain more
knowledge about representational modalities we can then begin to extend the complexity of the interface to examine the influence of other aspects, such as, for instance, interaction style
and more complex design features. This, along with the other
unanswered questions presented in this section may be valuable inspiration for future researchers.
9.5

a final remark

I conclude my thesis with a call to research communities to address the unanswered question outline above, but it also my
hope that further collaboration and cross-pollination will be
stimulated between somewhat dispirit communities to work together on the issue we all face when representing data. While
the primary audience of this thesis is the HCI community, at
various stages throughout I have leveraged on theoretical and
practical research produced by other communities to help shape
a more holistic understanding of the state-of-the-art in data representation.
Through this journey I have encountered many different approaches, methods, definitions and terminology, which are used
to define and explain various ways of studying data representation. This has led me to question: can all representation that
utilizes modalities alongside and beyond the visual modality be considered visualization? New media theorist Lev Manovich [172] defines information visualization simply as “a mapping between
discrete data and a visual representation”, while Eric Rodenbeck, during his keynote address at the 2008 O’Reilly Emerging

285

286

thesis summary

Technology Conference spoke about information visualization
as “becoming more than a set of tools and technologies and
techniques to understand large data sets. It is emerging as a
medium in its own right, with a wide range of expressive potential.”1 If we subscribe to the concept of defining information
visualization as a medium, can we then disassociate the meaning of the word visualization from the visual modality, and propose that data represented in any modality or combination of
modalities may be considered to be information visualization
and not data sculpture, data art, sonification, physicalization, sensualization, sensification, perceptualization or even multisensory data
representation? I believe that by accepting this concept, while
also acknowledging the broad expertise needed to meet the
theoretical and practical challenges, the HCI community, alongside others, such as InfoVis and the Artistic Community, can
play central roles in the future developments and study of Information Visualization.

JS’s experience of reading the data visualization: Principle economic status of women, 2011 (see pie chart above) Researcher:
Trevor Hogan Participant: (JS Female 33 year old Business Analyst)
Interviewer: Ok so what we are going to be doing here is an
interview that will look at your experience of reading this data
visualisation.... this approach tries to facilitate you to go back
and recount an experience that you have had in the past and in
this case we are looking at data visualizations and in particular
we are trying to get at the moment in time when a visualization
changes, for you, from a collection of abstract colours, shapes,
patterns, numbers, letters into some sort of concrete knowledge
on your behalf. The method we are using is the elicitation interview technique and we are trying to get you to describe the
experience as it unfolded over time and then at certain points
we are going to go back to specific moments during to probe

291

292

sample elicitation interview

these further.
JS: Ok
Interviewer:..Ok, so can we go back to that moment when
you read the data visualizations, did you read it once or twice
JS: Am, twice
Interviewer: Twice, and so which occasion did you spend
most time with it
JS: The first time.
Interviewer: The first time, and what was your rationale for
reading it the second time?
JS: am, just going back over it, just having another look to
see if I see anything more
Interviewer: Ok, was it just to confirm
JS: Yea yea
Interviewer: Ok, so we will focus in on the first time you
read it
JS: em hem
Interviewer: ok, so when was this?
JS: ah, quarter past 7 this morning
Interviewer: ok and where are you?
JS: at work
Interviewer: at work ok, so are you at a desk
JS: I was at my desk yea
Interviewer: and is it printed out?

sample elicitation interview

JS: no it is on my computer screen
Interviewer: ok, so is it on your computer screen in front of
you?
JS: yes
Interviewer: is it the only thing that is open on the computer
screen?
JS: am long pause I have a double screen and I have my outlook open on the left pointing to the left and I have the data
visualization open on the right (pointing to the right)
Interviewer: ok and how far to the right is it, is it 45 degrees?
JS: ah am, I am not sure of the exact angle but from where I
am sitting I am looking at the exact centre of the two screens,
with one on the right and one on the left (pointing to the right
and then left)
Interviewer: ok so it’s on the one on the right (pointing to
the right and then left)
JS: yea yes
Interviewer: and on the screen, is there anything around it
JS: No
Interviewer: Ok, are there any sounds in the environment if
you go back to that time
JS: (3 second pause)...yea, because the reason I stopped looking at it was because of people arriving at work, so there is an
increased level of noise, people are coming in
Interviewer: ok, so is there any particular noise that you can
remember during this time
JS: No not when I started, but towards the end when I was
almost close to finishing looking at it, or it was more that when
the noise got louder I made the decision myself, say ok no there

293

294

sample elicitation interview

is no point in looking at this anymore because I will be unable
to concentrate on it
Interviewer: ok, so there are some ambient noise but some
were louder, some noises are louder than others
JS: yes, people talking [Interviewer: ok] that is the noises
Interviewer: ok, and when you are at your desk are you sitting or standing
JS: sitting
Interviewer: are you sitting upright
JS: yea
Interviewer: so are you very straight, is your back very straight
or..
JS: long pauseI can’t really recall, I am not 100% sure, it could
be that I am leaning forward on the desk or I am sitting upright
(bends forward and back in the chair)
Interviewer: and are your hands on the table or are they on
your body
JS: No I kinda think that I have the feeling that I am leaning
forward, more leaning onto my hand (mimics the position)
Interviewer: so leaning on your hand
JS: yea, underneath my chin (mimics the pose she was in)
Interviewer: ok ok and you have the computer screen in front
of you, is there anything else on the desk besides the computer
screen?
JS: am (long pause) yea, I have my keyboard, I have my drink
bottle, I have my coffee
Interviewer: and where is you coffee, on the left or

sample elicitation interview

JS: on the left
Interviewer: and is it strong coffee
JS: yes, strong and freshly made
Interviewer: can you smell it, now
JS: yes very much so
Interviewer: and the drink bottle is on the right?
JS: no, they are both on my left
Interviewer: Ok if you agree I would like you to go back to
the time and place when you first begin to read the visualization and try to recount what you are doing as if you are doing
it now...Once you are there, take your time
JS: OK (shuts eyes, pauses, then opens eyes and stares into
space)
Interviewer: Please tell me how do you start to read the visualization? [I: am] what is the first thing you do
JS: the first thing I notice while looking at the data visualization is the confusing, the kind of patterns of the data visualization so even before I even read the data itself I find the way that
the patterns fitted together in the circle, in the pie chart ah it
looks a bit dizzy
Interviewer: Ok so is that the first thing you look at when
you began to read?
JS: It is the, not necessarily specifically looking as in reading
anything but it is the first impression when I opened the page
Interviewer: ok it was the first thing that grabs your attention
JS: the first thing that grabs my attention was am, it reminded
me of a kind of a some kind of 3D thing, where it starts to move
around that was the first thing that I saw before I even started

295

296

sample elicitation interview

looking at the actual data behind it
Interviewer: ok, so that grabs your attention what is it that
you done next?
JS: am, the next thing I think was I kind of look at the most
significant data that is there and...
Interviewer: when you say most significant?
JS: it is the biggest parts of the pie [Interviewer: ok] so there
is one at the bottom that displays almost 50% of the data and
the is one that was almost kind of a third of the data and they
are the ones that I looked at first [R: ok] to see and am the next
thing I remember, I just read what they would represent [R: eh
em] and what surprises me is the large amount of women staying at home minding the house, minding people, was almost a
third of women
JS: ok ok so you focus in on the two largest chunks of the pie
chart first [Interviewer: yea] and then what came next for you
after that?
JS: am long pause yea I focus on the large ones and then look,
ok what are the other ones made up of and am long pause I
think initially it is more just reading the numbers but then it,
ah, kind of I start, ok, I look at the data to see what is it about
and, ah, it’s, I look at the smaller data as well so really to make
sure that the economical status of women, what does that really
mean, so it was what are women doing at that time or whatever
that year and I kind of, am, I start looking to make sure I understand the chart to think about my own situation and people
I know in my surroundings [R: eh em] and the surprise that I
have about the large amount of women being at home which
was a third and then I am surprised about the low number of
women unemployed [Interviewer: eh em] that is a pretty small
number and ah am I found that there is more women retired
than unemployed [Interviewer: eh em] but it is kind of pretty
much the same and that there is more women studying than
unemployed so I kind of put the different data pieces into relation with each other to to kind of try to understand and and I
think by doing that that is a way for me to memorize it, no not
necessarily memorizing it but understanding it and getting to

sample elicitation interview

grips with it
Interviewer: Ok so when you say that you put the different
parts together, how do you do this?
JS: How do I put things together is am... trying to in the environment that I am living then trying to apply what I am seeing
so what I mean is, everyone knows that there is loads of unemployment in Ireland and the n you see data like this and there is
a very small number that are unemployed and there are a huge
number of women that are staying at home and minding the
house and there are still 50% of them employed, [Interviewer:
ok] so it is kind of putting them together as in applying the
individual %’s to my own surroundings, do they make sense
Interviewer: ok, so what was it you do next, you said that
you have focused in on the detail of each section [JS: yea] and
thought about the implications of this [JS: yea] what do you do
next after that
JS: One of the things that I do notice next is, I read the title
to go back over ok is this data only representing from one year
but one thing that stuck out for me in the chart and I only began to look at this towards the end of it all as well was am the
source and it was not very clear am it just said source CSO so
kind of is that an Irish agency or whatever so I just thought ok
it would be interesting to know how the data was put together
and am the other thing was well I even think before I done that
there was a few things that came into my mind long pause am
ok if there is only about 7% or something like that unemployed
because it is such a low number I started reasoning in my head
what could be the reason for such a low number and maybe
the statistic means it’s only women who are solely unemployed
and do nothing else but maybe women who have a part-time
job or are only working 5 hours a week and are still on the dole
are they not considered unemployed anymore and how is that
taken into account in the statistics so I think the more I looked
at it the more I questioned the statistic and the more questions
that came up that it would be interesting to know and to see
more data behind it

297

298

sample elicitation interview

Interviewer: Ok so when you say you reasoned it in-yourhead, how do you reason about this in your head?
JS: what I mean with that is the low number of women in that
statistic didn’t seem logical to me so I tried to come up with a
reason why could it be so low [R: eh em] and that’s what I mean
I reason in my own head, what could it be that it is so low,
maybe it is that ah because a lot of women that are minding
their children at home they are not considered unemployed,
maybe because it is that ah people are on-the-dole that they are
still employed on a part-time basis so it is kind of I try to reason
how come there is such a low number or percentage of women
unemployed when Ireland has such a large % of unemployment
(...)
Interviewer: So if it is ok for you to go back to a particular
moment when you seem to be surprised that a number was so
low
JS: yea, it is more the question “how come this number is so
low”
Interviewer: so so is it someone or something asking that
question in-you-mind?
JS: yea I don’t know if it is someone or something or whatever, it feels, I feel that it is myself asking the question “how
come this number is so low”
Interviewer: and do you hear your own voice asking that
question? is it your voice or is it someone else’s
JS: it is my thoughts, it is my voice, it is asking me the question using my voice
Interviewer: Is that voice loud or quiet?
JS: no, it is normal
Interviewer: just normal [JS: ok] and is it from a distance
away or is it from very close to you? if you try to go back to
that time when you experienced those questions

sample elicitation interview

JS: No it is not distant, it is just, it’s here it is with me
Interviewer: is it behind you or in front of you [Interviewer:
no] is it inside you?
JS: it is from inside
Interviewer: Inside your body or inside your head
JS: oh, it is inside my head
Interviewer: ok and it is just speaking in a normal voice, your
normal, everyday voice [JS: yea yea yea] ok and do you answer
that question
JS: I am trying to answer it, if that voice is asking that question well then I am trying to answer that question
Interviewer: ok, so when you have looked at these sections in
detail and after you have posed these questions and attempted
to answer them you mentioned that this was then close to the
end your time reading the visualization, how do you know
when you are finished?
JS: At no particular point did I feel that I was finished but
that was when all the other colleagues arrived and there was
one particular person arriving and she has an extremely loud
voice and am... (...) I kind of said no I have to stop this now (...)
Interviewer: and again when you say that “I have to stop this
now” is that you again saying that in-your-head?
JS: yea that is me in-my-head saying it because I can’t, at that
moment I have to stop this because I can’t concentrate on my
own thought processes that I’d need
Interviewer: Ok so how do you finish with it then?
JS: am long pause I was fairly annoyed that I had to stop
because that person was annoying me so really I didn’t finish
by saying, it was kind of two ways now, on one way I am ok
that’s interesting data and I am going to close this now and on
the other half was “god that person is annoying me” so as I

299

300

sample elicitation interview

was finishing it I was already entering another thought process
with the groups and what they are talking about and my mind
was occupied
Interviewer: ok good, and when you were finish do you close
down the document
JS: am no I left it open, I had it opened as a separate tab on
my Internet Explorer and I thought I’d leave it open in case I
will just come back to it at a later stage am but I I think I got
up from my desk
Interviewer: you stood up?] I stood up because at that stage
the people that were right across from me were talking as well
and I kind of go involved in their conversation
Interviewer: ok, so if we go, one of the things that you said
at one point was that you felt a sense of surprise when you saw
a large amount of women that stay at home with their family
[JS: em] can you describe how that sense of surprise came over
you? Is it something that happened over a prolonged time or..
JS: No I feel that it was at the start
Interviewer: and is it a shock surprise or was it ...
JS: no it wasn’t such a shock it was more “oh I wouldn’t have
thought that” so it wasn’t a “Oh my god” surprise it was just,
it is interesting
Interviewer: ok so when you say “oh I wouldn’t have thought
that” again is that a voice in-your-head saying that
JS: yea (abrupt)
Interviewer: and, and when you say that “oh I wouldn’t have
thought that” what do you do at that point, how does that
change your viewing of the chart
JS: em long pause I think that is what, I don’t know if it
changes it, I think it brought me onto the other parts of the
data to see what are the other women doing if such a large part
are staying at home and like 2 thirds of women are either working or staying at home, so what are the other ones made up of

sample elicitation interview

and the other thing as well is ah am that it brought thoughts
into my head of women actually minding home, like mothers
staying at home
Interviewer: ok and when you say it brings thoughts of mothers...
JS: I could see women working in the kitchen
Interviewer: now?
JS: now as well but I could see women working in the kitchen
as I looked at the charts, it is this kind of visual of the kind of
what is portrayed of women working and minding at home, so
it is women minding old people or minding families members
or things like that
Interviewer: Ok so when you said there that you saw images
of women minding people at home, are they images of women
that you know, do you recognize any of their faces?
JS: No (long pause, looks into space) they are more
Interviewer: Is it you?
JS: No
Interviewer: are they familiar to you
JS: No, I don’t think so, it is more like you see them in an ad,
a stereotype of a housewife
Interviewer: ok and so can you remember at that point were
you looking at the pie chart or do they appear in front of you,
the images I mean
JS: am, I can say that they appeared in-my-head, I can’t say
that they appeared in front of me, it was in my head
Interviewer: are they clear or fuzzy
JS: No they are fairly clear

301

302

sample elicitation interview

Interviewer: were they moving, is it like a film or a photograph
JS: No they are moving
Interviewer: are you in it? could you see yourself looking at
the film or could you just see the film
JS: just the film
Interviewer: is it a distance away
JS: No, it’s close, I don’t, I don’t feel like watching it from a
distance or like a film in a cinema, they are just in my head [I:
ok]
(...)
Interviewer: Ok and how do you try to bring people that
you know into this, if we go back to you reading the chart, how
does that happen?
JS: god I don’t know how it happens, it just happens
Interviewer: Do you see images of these people you know,
do you hear sounds from the people that you know? [JS: no]
Do you see any images or sounds from yourself? [JS: no] how
do you connect sections of the chart with your own situation or
of people that you know, is it just a sense?
JS: It is just a sense, it is just a thought, it’s not that I see or
hear them
Interviewer: so it is just a feeling
JS: yea
Interviewer: and is that a warm feeling
JS: long pause I don’t know it is just a feeling
Interviewer: so it is a feeling you get when you look at a section of the chart and you associate that section with yourself or
someone you know?

sample elicitation interview

JS: It is not a section that is associated with me it’s more how
do I, my life, my surroundings fit into that data, so this is a
data visualization of Irish women and how or would I feel the
same data from my friends do I get a sense that what I am seeing is true to what I see in my life [Interviewer: ok] but I can’t
necessarily say that I see people that I know, it is more or less
just a feeling I get
Interviewer: ok so I am now going to go through what you
experienced and if I leave out anything please stop me [JS: ok]
ok so you were at work sitting in front of your computer screen,
you were sitting down your hands may have been on the table
or supporting your chin, the screen was slightly to the right
of you, there were some ambient sounds but some were more
distractive particularly at the end [I: yea, really much at the
end] and there was a cup of coffee and a bottle of water on the
left side of the table. So when you started the first thing that
grabbed your attention was the patterns, how garish and possibly how they looked like 3D images because of the use of these
particular patterns
JS: Yea it was just kind of I just thought that who would represent data like that because it was very hard on the eye
Interviewer: ok so then you began to focus on the two largest
sections and you felt a sense of surprise after reading one of
these, then you, that triggered you to move on and look into
more detail at the other small sections and you began to analyze the implications of these and at a certain point you began
to connect your own situation and how you possibly would be
placed into this chart and how people around you fit into this
data [I: yes] so once you have do that then there came a point
when someone in your office was particularly loud and this
distracted you and you felt that you had to close the document
without feeling that you had finished reading it fully
JS: What I would say is that I was in the middle of my
thought process when that interruption came, so I was not satisfied that I had got my head fully around the chart and yea I
was not satisfied at all

sample elicitation interview

Interviewer: ok so you were distracted by someone and then
finished it at that point
JS: I just made a conscious decision that at that point and
with the things going on around me I couldn’t concentrate...
Interviewer: but you didn’t close you left it open in a separate tab so if you wanted to go back to it you could, ok so did I
leave out any detail that you would like to add
JS: no
Interviewer: no, ok thanks very much the interview is now
complete.
