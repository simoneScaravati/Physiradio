A Baby’s First Year In Data, As A Blanket

New parents will tell you that a baby takes a few months to acquire something close to a day/night
sleep pattern, and during that time Mom and Dad also find their sleep becomes a a rarely-snatched
luxury. [Seung Lee] has turned this experience into a unique data visualisation, by taking the sleep
pattern data of his son’s first year of life and knitting it into a blanket.
The data was recorded using the Baby Connect app, from which it was exported and converted to
JSON. This was in turn fed to some HTML/Javascript which generated a knitting pattern in a handy
format that could be displayed on any mobile or portable device for knitting on the go. The blanket
was then knitted by hand as a series of panels that were later joined into one, providing relief as the
rows lined up.
The finished product shows very well the progression as the youngster adapts to a regular sleep
pattern, and even shows a shift to the right at the very bottom as a result of a trip across time zones
to see relatives. It’s both a good visualisation and a unique keepsake that the baby will treasure one
day as an adult. (Snarky Ed Note: Or bring along to the therapist as evidence.)
This blanket was hand-knitted, but it’s not the first knitted project we’ve seen. How about a map of
the Universe created on a hacked knitting machine?
