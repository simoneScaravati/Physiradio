ABSTRACT

This paper describes a study comparing the information recall of participants using 2D and 3D physical visualizations.
Specifically, it focuses on physical bar charts and evaluates the
difference between a paper-based visualization and a version
built with wooden blocks. We conducted a repeated measures study involving 16 participants in which we measured
the recall of information immediately after the exploration
and with a delay of one week. We used questionnaires and
semi-structured interviews to obtain more information about
the process of recall and participants’ opinions whether and
how the visualizations differ in their potential for memorizing
information. The results point out that participants believe to
remember the 3D visualizations better, but besides the recall of
extreme values the quantitative data cannot completely verify
this appreciation. Furthermore the results highlight that the
in the study used physical interaction techniques are not able
to compensate lacking visual differentiation. One surprising
finding was the strong dependency of the different data sets
on the recall performance.

their design and creation [27]. However, research about physical visualizations is still at its beginning and further studies
have to be conducted to investigate and compare them to alternative representation methods in order to develop strong
formal evidence for their benefits [15].

INTRODUCTION

While digital information visualization (infovis) has a long research history, visualizations that go beyond flat digital screens
have only recently started to attract attention. This development is supported by advances in digital fabrication and shapechanging displays and raises questions about how to design
effective 3D visualizations for physical devices and how to
study such systems to explore their potential [15].

This article attempts to provide a better understanding of which
characteristics of physical bar charts influence the perception
and memorization of information. In a repeated measures
study with 16 participants we compared a 2D and a 3D version
of token-based physical visualizations (see figure 1). Recall
performance was measured by a quiz once immediately after
exploration, and again after two weeks. Questionnaires and
semi-structured interviews were used in order to gain further
insights. The results show that characteristics that are unique
to the 3D modality such as volume had a strong influence on
the recall of information for extreme values. While the physical interaction with the visualizations to which we encouraged
participants seemed not to have an effect on the performance,
the underlying data sets had a much stronger influence than
expected.

Within this new field of research, studies have shown that 3D
physical bar charts can have benefits compared to digital visualizations for information retrieval tasks [14] or the recall
of information [25]. Other studies of physical visualizations

for all tasks and that physical 3D bar charts performed better
than the digital version. According to the authors this study
was limited in the tasks and modalities used. Stusak et al. [25]
took a similar approach, but focused on memorability of 2D
bar charts in the digital and physical modality. The study
found that participants forgot significantly less facts about
maximum and minimum values within two weeks, when these
were perceived from the physical bar chart. The study design
allowed no comparative statements for both modalities by the
participants. The authors mention that participants did hardly
explore the physical visualization haptically and they suggest
that further studies should investigate tasks that more clearly
require physical interaction. The research agenda article about
physicalizations by Jansen et al. [15] in addition encourages
further studies that measure benefits beyond time and error
and take various modalities into account, such as paper and
ink.

MOTIVATION & BACKGROUND

Our work builds on research in the areas of digital and physical
data representations and information recall, specifically regarding physical objects. The comparative study described in this
paper investigates which characteristics of physical visualizations influence their memorability and how this potential can
be used. Our main research questions are:
• Does the dimensionality of a physical visualization and the
related characteristics such as weight or volume have an
influence on the perception and recall of information?
• Do physical interactions such as disassembling, reassembling, grasping and lifting influence the perception and
recall of information?
Data Representation & Memorability

Tangibles & Memorability

A fundamental goal of the visual representation of data is to
amplify cognition [4] and help to provide an understanding
of otherwise complex data [20]. A visualization can extend
human memory [33] and therefore studies about memorability
are a frequently discussed topic in information visualization.

The idea of tangible interfaces is to embody digital information in physical space and therefore make use of the wellevolved human capability to sense and manipulate the physical
world [13]. There are several tangible examples of visualizations. Hancock et al. [10] studied the navigation of circular
tree structures via tangibles and touch. Jetter et al. [16] presented a technique that combines information visualization
and tangibles to facilitate physical search queries. However,
these projects concentrate on data manipulation with tangibles,
not on data representation through tangibles.

The results of a study by Borkin et al. [3] showed that visualizations are more memorable when they include objects or
pictures that are easily recognized by humans. However, this
does not clarify whether facts about the underlying data and
information could be perceived and remembered better as the
visualizations were only presented for 1 second. Guidelines
for effective visualizations advise to limit a representation of
data to the minimum of necessary visual elements and to avoid
so-called chartjunk [31], which is not required to comprehend the information, or even distracts the viewer. In contrast,
Bateman et al. [1] could show that chartjunk can enhance
memorability at least for simple data sets. It is worth mentioning that the extra visual elements in their study were quite
elaborate handmade illustrations and artistically embedded
into the visualizations.

O’Malley and Fraser [23] argue that there can be real benefits for learning from tangible interfaces and that carefully
designed physical interactions can simplify problem solving
tasks. Zuckerman et al. [36] state that the natural way to learn
engages multiple senses in a constructive process. Studies by
Easton et al. [9] indicate a shared abstract representation of
object shape and structure for vision and haptics. Interestingly
this is only the case for implicit memory tests, while explicit
tests imply that the recognition system keeps track of the
modality through which an object is experienced. Kerzel [18]
supports the principle of intermodal information transfer with
his finding that visual short-term memory is influenced by haptic perception. Similarly the experiments by Kelly et al. [17]
propose that locations that are learned with different senses
are represented within a common reference frame and that
haptic experiences influence visually perceived memories. In
addition studies showed that physical objects were recalled
better than pictures, and pictures better than words [2].

A study by Tory et al. [29] that compared spatializations found
that the influence of additional visual elements and metaphors
was hard to predict. Visual memory was more accurate when
the data was perceived via dot displays and 3D landscapes
compared to 2D landscapes. They also observed that the redundant encoding of data by using color and height in landscapes
improved memory in comparison to color alone. Whether the
additional dimension that is implied by a 3D physical visualization is rather an unnecessary embellishment or supports
the perception and memorability of information remains to be
investigated.

This leads to the assumption that a physical representation of
information could generate a more complete or detailed spatial
representation in the subject’s memory. However, although
studies often show positive effects in the use of physical materials in education, it is not clear whether this is due to their
physicality or rather to the fact that learning with physical
objects typically makes use of active learning and represents
information in a more salient way [30]. In addition several
studies in the area of tangible interaction could not show a
clear difference between the physical and virtual modality
(e.g. [30, 22, 35]). However, we believe that results in the

Cockburn and McKenzie [6] investigated the effectiveness
of spatial memory for physical and digital arrangements of
images in 2D and 3D. The users found interfaces with more
dimensions less efficient, but the physical modality performed
better than the on-screen modality. The first study that compared physical visualizations to their digital counterparts for
low-level information retrieval tasks was done by Jansen et
al. [14]. The results showed that 2D bar charts performed best

area of information visualization can differ as the previously
stated studies have investigated the understanding of concepts,
supposedly stored in the nondeclarative memory, but information visualization rather conveys factual information and
correlations stored in the declarative memory. Our study furthermore focuses on the difference between the 2D and 3D
modality and investigates whether the unique characteristics
of physical objects that can be perceived haptically [21] can
enhance memorability.

Data Sets

We used country indicator data from the Human Development
Report (HDR) as the underlying data set. The topics were
population and economic trends. For both topics two data sets
were extracted, each consisting of the values for six countries
and five subtopics. In total we had four data sets with 30 data
points each. The topics of the data sets and their complexity
are in line with previous studies (e.g. [14, 25]).
Visualization Type

To minimize the influence of difficulties in reading or interpretation on the results we chose a well-known vertical bar chart
as the basic visualization type. In previous studies [14, 25]
physical interaction was limited to touching single bars. With
this study we wanted to include further unique operations on
physical visualizations such as grasping and lifting single data
points. In order to achieve this we followed a token-based
approach [12], where each data point is represented by an
independent physical token.

Memorability & Interference

While it is not possible to cope the entire research area of cognitive psychology and all theories regarding learning, memorizing and gaining knowledge, we would like to highlight
some key aspects related to our study design and findings.
Jean Piaget’s theory of constructivist learning assumes that the
assimilation of external information is dominated by internal
constructions and that learning is contextual, which means
that humans learn in relationship to previous knowledge (e.g.
[11]).

Visualization Modalities

According to the interference theory interaction between new
and past learned knowledge can have a negative influence on
the speed of learning and memory performance. The two main
kinds of interference are proactive and retroactive interference. The former explains the forgetting of new information
because of memories and knowledge that was learned beforehand (e.g. [32]). The latter describes the phenomenon when
newly learned information is disrupting or hindering the recall
of previous learned knowledge (e.g. [34]).

The final designs of the two visualization modalities can be
seen in figure 1. We decided to concentrate on the dimensionality of physical visualizations and exclude their digital
counterparts. Specifically we compared paper-based 2D bar
charts with a 3D version built from wooden blocks. The single
bars of both visualizations had the same size, similar colors for
each category and small printed flags on them. To encourage
physical interaction with the visualization we decided against
labeling the bars with numeric values, but instead provided a
stand-alone scale (see figure 2c&d) for reading exact values.

PHYSICAL VISUALIZATIONS

STUDY DESIGN

Based on the related studies above we decided to focus on the
following aspects with our visualizations and the study:

The goal of our study was to learn more about the role of
the various physical characteristics of physical visualizations
regarding the perception and recall of the underlying information. We also wanted to gain some understanding whether and
how physical interactions influence this process. To achieve
this, we first ran a within-subjects repeated measures study
with the independent variables data set (2 levels) and modality
(2 levels). The resulting four conditions were counterbalanced
using a latin square. As the dependent variable, we measured recall performance (percentage of correct answers) once
immediately after the exploration, and once with a delay of
one week. In addition to this controlled experiment, we also
conducted semi-structured interviews to find out about the
subjects’ own judgements.

Tap Potential & Encourage Interaction. Physical visualizations have physical characteristics such as weight, texture
and hardness, which clearly distinguish them from digital
visualizations. To tap this potential participants should be
encouraged to explore and sense these properties. Our visualizations should support and encourage haptic interactions that
go beyond touching single bars.
Enable Comparability. Finding the right alternative to a
physical visualization for conducting a comparative study is
difficult [15]. The data encoding, interaction techniques and
physical size should be kept as similar as possible in order
to achieve valid and informative results [14]. Besides digital
visualizations, other baselines such as paper or whiteboards
should be given consideration.

Participants

We announced our study by email and social network and
recruited 16 participants (5 female) with a mean age of 22.8
years. They were predominantly students of human-computer
interaction (14 out of 16). Participants received a 10 Euro gift
coupon for an online store.

Spatial Frame of Reference. Haptic interaction can allow
great flexibility in creating a visualization. This creates the
danger of loosing a fixed spatial frame of reference that implies the important visual variable of spatial position. The
mapping and memorization of single bars to specific categories or countries could, for example, be more difficult if the
spatial arrangement varies too often. The shaping of a spatial
frame of reference should be supported without limiting the
possible haptic interactions.

Procedure

The study took place in an isolated and quiet room. We used
a repeated measures design for the study which means that
each participant worked with both visualization modalities. In

bars (see figure 2c) and state the outcomes of summarized
values (see figure 2d). Participants were encouraged to use the
stand-alone scales to fulfill these tasks.

After a consent form and a demographic questionnaire the
first session started with the exploration phase: one of the
visualizations representing one of the data sets was presented
to each participant in a counterbalanced order. Participants
fulfilled several tasks with each visualization and were also
asked to rate aspects such as memorability, fun and ease of
use respectively on 5-point Likert scales. Participants were
not told to memorize the facts of the visualization in order to
test implicit memorization.

Data Collection & Analysis

In order to evaluate the recall performance and to further analyze and interpret the study results we gathered the following
types of data:
Observation. The study leader observed the participants during the study and took notes, e.g., of unexpected behavior.
Video. We videotaped the entire process with two cameras
from different viewing angles: a view from the front and one
from the back over the participants’ shoulder. The video was
mainly used to recapitulate and analyze unexpected interactions and behavior.

The recall phase started directly after exploring both visualizations: participants had to complete online quizzes about
each data set in the same order as the presented visualizations.
We advised participants to leave unknown questions blank
instead of guessing the right answer. No feedback on the performance or the correct answers to the quizzes were given nor
did participants know the procedure of the second session.

Questionnaires. We used pen-and-paper questionnaires to
gather demographic information and the participants’ opinions
on the visualizations.

The second session started with a short semi-structured interview, in which participants were asked which visualization
seemed to be “more present” after one week and whether they
remembered any details to confirm their assumption. They
then had to fill out two online quizzes again. In a second semistructured interview participants were finally asked to what
extent they had used the memorized visualizations to answer
the questions and whether they had observed any differences
depending on the modality.

Interviews. We conducted semi-structured interviews in both
sessions. The goal of these interviews was to obtain more
information about their process of recall and their opinions
whether and how the visualizations differed in their potential
for memorizing information.
Quiz. To test the recall of information participants had to fill
out an online quiz directly after the exploration and with a
delay of one week. It contained different question categories:

Tasks

• extreme values: Questions about minimum and maximum
values, such as “Which country had the highest GDP growth
rate?”. Answers were chosen from a drop-down list and
consisted of either a specific country or a specific numeric
value.

The tasks of the study can be split into two main categories:
Assembling the visualization. Participants sat in front of
an empty table with geographically arranged flags and a legend with the order of the categories (see figure 2b). The
experimenter handed over a box containing all paper strips
or wooden blocks and asked the participants to assemble the
visualizations. Besides the order of the categories and the
rough position given by the flags on the table, participants had
no instructions how to fulfill this task exactly.

• general facts: General questions about the underlying data,
such as “In which countries did the GDP increase between
2000 and 2010?”. Answers were chosen by selecting the
corresponding checkboxes.

Retrieving and comparing single values. The experimenter
asked the participants to name the countries with the highest
and lowest values for each category. Furthermore they had
to give exact values for specific data points, compare specific

• summations: Questions that included the addition of values,
such as “In which countries is the addition of secondary and
tertiary education higher than 60%?” Answers were chosen
by selecting the corresponding checkboxes.

95

The quiz after one week contained several additional questions
that were not part of the first one:

3D

• image recognition: Pictures of the assembled physical bars
for one country were displayed, but without the attached
flags. Participants had to recognize the country and select
the corresponding checkbox.

2D

• additional general questions: General questions about the
underlying data which were not asked in the first quiz.

With these questions, we wanted to investigate whether participants only remembered the answers that they had given in

economic data set, as the percentage of correct answers is
generally much lower, independent of modality.

Self-Reports

Figure 4 looks only at the population data set and shows the
percentage of correct answers about extreme values. The split
into minima (lowest bars) and maxima (highest bars) reveals
that maximum values in general could be remembered better
in the 3D modality. While Figure 4 shows only the results for
the population data set, the economic data set shows a similar
trend but much less distinct.

We base all recall performance analyses and discussions on
effect sizes with 95% confidence intervals as used and recommended in previous work [5]. We decided to do this because
of growing concerns in several research fields regarding the
limits of null hypothesis significance testing for reporting and
interpreting experiment results [7, 8].
After each exploration of a visualization participants filled out
5-point Likert scale questionnaires (ranging from 1=strongly
disagree; to 5=strongly agree). Participants rated both visualizations as easy to use (2D: MODE=5, M=4.31, SE=0.22 /
3D: MODE=5, M=4.69, SE=0.15) and inviting to interact with
(2D: MODE=4, M=4.19, SE=0.16, 3D: MODE=5, M=4.69,
SE=0.15). This suggests that the results in the recall phase
are not influenced by reading or interaction difficulties. Participants found the 3D visualization more fun to interact with
(MODE=5, M=4.63, SE=0.13) compared to 2D (MODE=4,
M=3.81, SE=0.31) and considered the 3D modality more memorable (MODE=4, M=4.19, SE=0.19) than the 2D version
(MODE=3, M=3.06, SE=0.23).

Figure 5 shows a different view on the performance for the
economic data set. The results are grouped by participants
who had the economic data set encoded in the first or second
visualization for both modalities. The results show that the
order in which the visualizations for both data sets was handed
out had a clear influence on the recall of information from
the economic data set. Surprisingly, this effect could not be
observed for the population data set.

After both sessions participants had to rank which visualization was perceived as being more “present”. In the first session
11 participants ranked the 3D modality better (2D=3, no difference=2), in the second 14 participants had this opinion (2D=0,
no difference=2). While almost all participants ranked the
3D modality more “present” than 2D, they had difficulties
to support this assumption, e.g. by giving details about the
visualization.

The effect of the modality on the overall recall results for both
data sets combined revealed only a minor trend in favor of 3D.
The same was true for the results of the additional questions
that were only asked in the second session. We therefore ran a
more detailed analysis by looking separately at the results for
each data set.

of unique physical characteristics and physical interactions for
the perception and recall of information.

bars and measuring or comparing single bars to retrieve values. While two participants stated that the manual assembly
helped them two remember the categories and countries, most
participants described it as “mechanical” and tried to finish
it as fast as possible. The same applies for the measuring
interaction, where “mechanical” was again an often used term.
Some participants also declared that they had assumed that a
fast and unproblematic interaction with the bars was the focus
of the study and that the actual data was rather unimportant.

The Role of the Data Set

There is a clear difference of the recall results regarding the
two data sets. While the population data set indicates an advantage for the 3D modality in both quizzes, the economic
data set shows no such difference. In the semi-structured interviews, we learned that most participants bore no relation
to economic topics and stated that the data was too abstract
and less interesting. This might have been a side effect of our
choice of HCI, i.e., computer science students as the subjects
and could be explained with the presumption of contextual
learning and the constructivism theory. In contrast, participants stated that the population data set consisted of “concrete
and easily imaginable categories”. These aspects seemed to
have a relevant influence on the perception and memorization
of the visualization and the underlying data

Further statements of participants in the interviews in the second session emphasize that the physical interactions seemed
rather unnecessary and were performed almost automatically.
Four participants for example did not remember any use of the
stand-alone scale until an explicit question about it. Another
participant mentioned that he used the scale very rarely, which
is surprising considering that the measuring was a main part
of the study tasks.
This shows that the design of effective and meaningful physical interactions for physical visualizations is challenging and
that the chosen approach to “enforce” interaction was not productive. We believe that especially the high repetition of the
same, rather artificially encouraged, physical interaction of
assembling and moving paper stripes or wooden blocks was
too common to generate actual benefits. We suggest that future studies should offer a broader range of possible physical
interactions and try to emphasize particular insights into the
data set with the rare use of specific interactions.

The quiz results further indicate that the information gained
from a visualization encoding the economic data set is “overwritten” by the following information from the visualization
of the population data set, but not vice versa. This is in a
certain sense consistent with the phenomena described by the
interference theory. Questions about the economic data set
were left blank more often than questions about the population
data set, which suggests that participants did not remember
the information wrong, but had difficulties in remembering it
at all.
A detailed look at the range of values in both data sets provides
an additional potential explanation: The distance between extreme values and their neighbors was higher in the population
data set, and the resulting more distinct visual differences
could potentially also increase the potential for memorization.

The Role of Modality

The results show that participants could remember information
better when they perceived it with the 3D modality. This is
especially the case for extreme values, which confirms the
results of the study by Stusak et al. [25]. They argue that the
results can be attributed to the “vivid physical height of the
bars”, which is in line with the findings of Scott [24] that
object names are less memorable than pictures, because they
are less distinctive. Our study furthermore reveals that the
distinctiveness is based on the 3D modality and not mandatory
for physical visualizations, as the 2D modality in our study
led to similar results as the digital bar charts in the study by
Stusak et al. [25].

As a critical aspect, it should be mentioned that visualizations
are often used to make complex data more accessible and it
seems that the chosen visualizations were not able to fulfill this
purpose well for the economic data set. In general, our study
shows that the data set has a strong influence on the recall
performance and therefore the choice of test data sets should
be well-considered, especially for studies about memorability.
We furthermore suggest, that future studies should consider the
role of the underlying data more carefully, e.g., by integrating
the exploration and analysis of a visualization into a main
problem solving tasks, where comprehension of the data is
required and meaningful.

We believe that the additional characteristics of the 3D wooden
blocks such as the top and side faces or the volume contribute
to the distinctiveness and explain the benefits compared to
the 2D paper stripes. One participant furthermore stated that
the 3D modality replaced the 2D modality completely in her
impression. None of the participants said that they did notably
perceive the weight of a single wooden block or could make
use of the sensed information. This is probably the case because humans have evolved an expectation and “sensation”
about the weight of common physical objects.

The Role of Interaction

As stated before the visual difference between extremes and
the neighboring values was higher in the population data set.
This also had an effect on the interaction, as participants directly compared two bars in the economic data set on average
almost six times to identify the higher or lower one. This was
uncommon for the population data set, in which such comparisons were made only two times on average. However, the
results imply that the higher number of interactions could not
compensate the lack in visual differentiation.

As we do not believe that one of our two visualization modalities is more novel or ordinary than the other, we assume that
we can rule out a novelty effect, which is often claimed in the
case of physical visualizations.

The physical interactions during the study consisted of two
main parts: assembling the overall visualizations from single

SUMMARY AND FUTURE WORK

With the goal to investigate the influence of the particular
properties of physical visualizations, such as weight, volume
or texture, on their memorability, we have run a comparative
study between 2D paper bar charts and 3D bar charts built
from wooden blocks. We used two different data sets and
evaluated recall performance immediately after exploration
and with a delay of a week. The study was accompanied by
semi-structured interviews and questionnaires regarding the interactions done in the main task and the subjective assessment
of memorability.

When looking at the measured recall performance, we found
that with one data set, the 3D visualization caused a much
better recall in general than the 2D variant. With the other
data set, however, this effect was not present. A closer look at
the interview results revealed, that a main difference between
these data sets was, that participants could relate well to one
of them, while they found the other one too abstract and not
interesting. While the overall recall performance for the uninteresting data set was lower (as can be expected), also the
difference between the 3D and 2D visualizations in terms of
recall disappeared. This suggests that the particular properties
of spatiality and tangibility can show stronger benefits when
the underlying data set is also comprehensible and interesting.
In other words: The better the mind can grasp the information
behind a physical visualization, the more will grasping with
the hands help.

As stated in the discussion, we could not find an influence
of the physical factor weight, possibly because the weight
of objects in our studies was totally conform with typical
expectations. Further studies could try to investigate whether
breaking these expectations could generate additional benefits.
However, we believe that this effect might be limited regarding
scalability and could, for example, be used to highlight a single
data point. A different approach could be to use materials
with a higher density to increase the absolute difference in
weight. In the area of actuated physical visualizations, the
combination with weight changing user interfaces could, for
example, enable the adaption of the weight of single data
points and, therefore, modify the required physical exertion to
lift a particular data point.
