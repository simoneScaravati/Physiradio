  abstract     = {Physical representations of data have existed for thousands of years. Yet it is now that advances in digital fabrication, actuated tangible interfaces, and shape-changing displays are spurring an emerging area of research that we call Data Physicalization. It aims to help people explore, understand, and communicate data using computer-supported physical data representations. We call these representations physicalizations, analogously to visualizations – their purely visual counterpart. In this article, we go beyond the focused research questions addressed so far by delineating the research area, synthesizing its open challenges, and laying out a research agenda.},

  year     = {2019},
  abstract = {The home environment is a complex design
space, especially when it has multiple inhabitants. As
such, the home presents challenges for the design of
smart products. Householders may be different ages
and have differing interests, needs, and attitudes
towards technology. We pursued a research-through-
design study with family households to envision
and ‘co-create’ the future of data-enabled artifacts
for their homes. We have iteratively developed
domestic research artefacts for these households
that are open, data-enabled, physical visualisations.
These artefacts - called Domestic Widgets - are
customisable in their design and functionality
throughout their lifespan. The development process
highlights design challenges for sustained co-creation
and the leveraging of household creativity in (co-
creation) research toolkits. These include the need
to allow and inspire iterative customization, the
need to accommodate changing roles within the
home ecology, and the aim that such design should
be inclusive for all family members (irrespective of
age and technical proficiency), whilst maintaining
a role and purpose in the home. We invite the RTD
community to critically discuss our, and other,
open and iterative end-user designs for sustained
co-creation. By presenting unbuilt and interactive
pre-built Domestic Widgets, we interactively foster
engagement with practises of sustained co-creation.},

elements of this practice to the ways in which it
democratizes design and manufacturing. This democratized
technological practice, we argue, unifies playfulness,
utility, and expressiveness, relying on some industrial
infrastructures while creating demand for new types of tools
and literacies. Thriving on top of collaborative digital
systems, the Maker movement both implicates and impacts
professional designers. As users move more towards
personalization and reappropriation, new design
opportunities are created for HCI.},

We propose a ‘human-data design’ approach in which end-users are given tools to create, share, and use data through tangible and physical visualizations. This paper introduces Physikit, a system designed to allow users to explore and engage with environmental data through physical ambient visualizations. We report on the design and implementation of Physikit, and present a two-week field study which showed that participants got an increased sense of the meaning of data, embellished and appropriated the basic visualizations to make them blend
into their homes, and used the visualizations as a probe for community engagement and social behavior.},

Negli ultimi anni vi è stato un progressivo aumento nella domanda di competenze in questo settore, sia in ambito professionale/industriale sia per le comunità di appassionati e principianti.
Questo testo offre un percorso didattico per coloro che hanno già competenze informatiche di base e vogliono iniziare un percorso multidisciplinare di introduzione ai sistemi embedded. Si inizia con le conoscenze basilari di elettronica ed hardware per poi passare alle nozioni per muovere i primi passi dal punto di vista del software, in modo semplice, pratico e sintetico.},

abstract={Playing appropriate music when watching images can make the images vivid and bring people into their intrinsic world. In this paper, we propose to musicalize images based on their emotions. Most of previous works on image emotion analysis mainly used elements-of-art based low-level visual features, which are vulnerable to the arrangements of elements. Here we propose to extract visual features, inspired by the concept of principles-of-art, to recognize image emotions. To enrich the descriptive power, a dimensional perspective is introduced to emotion modeling. Experiments on the IAPS dataset demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in comparison to the state-of-the-art methods for emotion regression. The music in MST dataset with approximate emotions to the recognized image emotions is selected to musicalize these images. The user study results show its effectiveness and popularity of the image musicalization method.},
