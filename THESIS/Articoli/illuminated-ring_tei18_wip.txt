Abstract
Data physicalizations are growing popular in many societal
domains which indicates a strong potential for fostering
public engagement thanks to public exhibition (e.g. in train
stations, in airports, on roundabouts, and in enterprises).
We focus on dynamic physical charts for visualizing
renewable energy forecasts in public spaces. To get charts
readable from any point of view around, we propose a
physical ring chart inspired by stone cairns. To build this
physical chart, we designed an expandable and stackable
illuminated ring. In this paper, we describe the design
process and the limitations of the first prototype of such
a ring.

Introduction
Tangible User Interfaces "give physical form to digital
information, employing physical artifacts both as
representations and controls for computational media"
[16]. Recently, Data Physicalization has emerged as a new
research area at the intersection of Data Visualization and
Tangible User Interfaces. In 2015, Jansen et al. [7] defined

Figure 1: Bar charts displayed with
InFORM [3].

Figure 3: EMERGE [15].

a Physicalization as "a physical artifact whose geometry or
material properties encode data" and propose to think of
Data Physicalization as a research area that "examines how
computer-supported, physical representations of data (i.e.,
physicalizations), can support cognition, communication,
learning, problem solving, and decision making". Static
Physicalizations are hard to modify, but the geometry
or material properties of Dynamic Physicalizations can
be modified (e.g. by computer-controlled actuators).
Examples of dynamic physicalizations are physical charts,
like the bar charts displayed with inFORM [3] (Figure 1),
like the Physical Data 2 (Figure 2), and like EMERGE [15]
(Figure 3). As noted by Jansen et al. [7], "The growing
popularity of data physicalizations in many societal domains
indicates a strong potential for fostering public engagement.
This popularity suggests that data physicalizations pique
interest, and this interest could in turn be leveraged to
have people spend more time and effort exploring and
understanding important and complex data".
In this paper, we explain our interest in using dynamic
physical charts to foster the shift of energy demand in
public spaces. We design CairnFORM, a dynamic physical
ring chart, for visualizing renewable energy forecasts. One
advantage of these ring charts is to be readable at 360˚.
They can be used to display data in public spaces where
people come and go to different directions such as entrance
halls, roundabouts, public places, train stations and airports.
We describe the design process of a first prototype of an
expandable illuminated ring which is the basis component
of the dynamic physical ring chart. Finally, we list some
limitations of the current prototype and we evoke future
works concerning the design and the study of CairnFORM.

Using Dynamic Physical Charts to Foster the
Shift of Energy Demand in Public Spaces
Using renewable energy rather than nonrenewable energy
is a strategy considered as appropriate for reducing
environmental impact. However, as energy generation
shifts to renewables and microgeneration1 , the interplay
between energy supply and energy demand becomes
more complex to manage. Critical problems, such as peak
demand, can lead to power outages and make the electrical
grid inefficient [4]. These issues are amplified by renewable
energy generation fluctuating with weather conditions (e.g.
sun, wind, wave, tide) and by a limited energy storage
capacity [5]. Unless energy storage becomes economically
and environmentally reliable to balance energy supply
against energy demand [10], we will need to synchronize
the energy demand with the availability of renewables.
During the last five years, researchers have designed and
studied systems to encourage users in using renewable
energy when there is plenty of it rather than when there
is little (i.e. shifting energy demand) [1, 8, 11, 12, 13, 14].
Most of the designed systems target households and
help inhabitants to plan their everyday energy usage by
visualizing renewable energy forecasts using graphical
charts such as clock charts [8, 13], timeline charts [13]
and line charts [8, 14].
To the extent of our knowledge, no dynamic physical chart
has been used for visualizing renewable energy forecasts in
a public space. Yet, as evoked by Zuckerman [17], tangible
interfaces have strengths that can contribute to "change
what people think and do" [2]: Visibility and Persistance;
Situatedness; Tangible representation; and Affordances.

Through these properties, tangible interfaces such as
dynamic physical charts can help reducing the intangibility
and the invisibility of energy that drives citizens away from
energy [11].

CairnFORM: a Dynamic Physical Ring Chart

Bar charts are data visualizations commonly used to
perform data comparisons over time. Therefore, bar charts
seem relevant for highlighting trends in renewable energy
forecasts such as incoming peaks of renewable energy.
In the literature, we found examples of dynamic physical
bar charts such as bar charts displayed with inFORM
[3] (Figure 1), Physical Charts2 (Figure 2) and EMERGE
[15] (Figure 3). However vertical bars are not readable at
360˚ around because of occlusion effects. This occlusion
effect can be countered by moving around the interface.
Nonetheless, users can hardly move around the interface
in many cases: train stations, public places, airports,
roundabouts are public spaces where people are in a hurry
and do not have time to change their point of view.
To counter this occlusion effect, we propose to use
a vertical physical chart readable at 360˚ around it.
Inspired by stone cairns (Figure 4), we propose to design
CairnFORM, a stack of expandable illuminated rings
that can morph to different cairn shapes (i.e. defined by
the number of rings and their diameter). For example, a
ten-rings-CairnFORM can represent renewable energy
forecasts for each hour of a workday (i.e. 8 am to 5 pm)
(Figure 5). The ring’s diameter and brightness would
both be correlated to the average power forecasted to be
generated in the hour: for a renewable power generation
capacity ranging from 0 W to max W, a forecast of 0 W
would be represented by a fully retracted ring with no
brightness and a forecast of max W would be represented
by a fully expanded ring with full brightness.

Designing an Expandable Illuminated Ring
The expandable illuminated ring is the basis component
of CairnFORM. To design an expandable illuminated ring,
we first looked for existing kinetic mechanisms allowing the
expansion of a ring. In the literature, AMPHORM [9] makes
use of expandable rings to shape a silicon skin: the result
is a shape-changing vase (amphora). The aluminium rings
of the skeleton of AMPHORM (Figure 6) are based on the
Hoberman mechanism [6]. Based on three existing kinetic
mechanisms, we iteratively prototyped a new expandable
ring mechanism. Finally, we added illumination to the
new expandable ring mechanism to obtain the current
expandable illuminated ring. All along the design process,
we eliminated expandable ring mechanisms that do not
meet the following criteria: 1) the kinetic mechanism has
inner-space available to put electronics (e.g. actuator,
sensor) for actuation; 2) the kinetic mechanism maintains a
regular ring-like shape during and after the expansion; and
3) the mechanism expands to a ring-like shape nearly two
times larger than its initial size. We detail these steps in the
following.
Existing Expandable Ring Mechanisms
We found three existing kinetic mechanisms allowing the
expansion of a ring (Figure 7):
1. HobermanRing-7points4 (Figure 7a) and
HobermanRing-12points5 (Figure 7b) are based
on the Hoberman mechanism and can expand to
a continuous ring-like shape two times larger than
its initial size. However during the expansion, the
ring shape changes in a seven-pointed star with
HobermanRing-7points and in a twelve-pointed star

with HobermanRing-12points. Moreover, very few
inner-space is available.
2. The structure DiscontinuousRing-6arms-6arcs6
(Figure 7c) maintains its ring-like shape during
the expansion and there is inner-space available.
However, it only expands to a discontinuous ring-like
shape less than two times larger than its initial size.

Iterative prototyping of a new expandable ring mechanism
Through iterative prototyping, we designed a new
expandable ring mechanism. Based on DiscontinuousRing6-6 and inspired by HobermanRing-7/12, we prototyped
three different expandable ring mechanisms before
obtaining the current version:

(b) IrregularRing-4arms-8arcs

1. DiscontinuousRing-4arms-4arcs (Figure 8a) can
expand to a shape three times larger than its initial
size. However, during the expansion, the ring shape
changes from a continuous ring to a discontinuous
rounded square.

to a continuous ring-like shape two times larger than

shape changes from a continuous regular ring to a
continuous irregular ring-like shape.
3. RingLike-8arms-8arcs (Figure 8c) can expand to a
continuous ring-like shape two times larger than its
initial size while maintaining a regular ring-like shape.
Adding illumination to the new expandable ring mechanism
Based on the RingLike-8arms-8arcs mechanism (Figure 9),
our final prototype of an expandable illuminated ring
(Figure 10) is composed of a column making the ring
stackable. The ring is actuated by a TRINAMIC stepper
motor QSH4218-41-10-035 with a transmission gear that
activates a wheel gear. The wheel activates four pinion
gears. Each pinion gear activates an axial rack and a
diagonal rack. At the edge of each rack, there is an arc
representing one eighth of a ø35 cm ring. When the ring is
fully retracted, the arcs form the initial ring (ø35 cm). When
the ring is fully expanded, the arcs form a ring-like shape
nearly two times larger than its initial size (ø62 cm). The
ring is illuminated by 24 NeoPixel Digital RGB LEDs (three
LEDs on each arc). Furthermore, a micro-switch is used to
sense when the ring is fully retracted.

Figure 9: The CAD model of the mechanism of the final expandable ring6 , designed with OnShape, a Cloud CAD Software.

The column was manufactured in PLA material using 3D
printing. All other parts were made in translucent PMMA
material using 2D laser cutting and assembled using
acetone. The remaining parts, mainly support parts, were
made in plywood using 2D laser cutting. Bolts, nuts and
washers were used to assemble all the parts together.
All LEDs and the stepper motor are powered by a ATX
computer power supply. The 24 LEDs are controlled using
an Arduino Mega2560. The stepper motor is controlled
using an Adafruit stepper motor HAT for Raspberry Pi. The
micro-switch is read using a pull-up circuit on an Adafruit
perma-proto HAT for Raspberry Pi. One Raspberry Pi 3 is
used to communicate with the Mega2560 (serial protocol)
and the HATs (I2C protocol). The driver is written in Python
2.7.

Limitations
We identified four limitations of the current prototype:

• Expansion range. The current prototype expands
with a 1.8 diameter scale factor (ranging from 35 cm
to 62 cm). The smallest the expansion range is, the
more the difference between each ring of the final
ring chart will be subtle to perceive. In our case, the
expansion range is 27 cm: to display a 256-point data
scale, the granularity would be only ∼1 mm, would be
∼3 mm for a 100-point data scale, and would more
reasonably be ∼1 cm for a 30-point data scale.

• Motion noise. When the ring is expanding, the
overall structure generates about 60 dB at a distance
of 1 meter, when the 5 V stepper motor QSH4218 is
at 60 RPM in double coil mode. This noise makes the
current ring intrusive: it should be used in situations
where noise does not reduce usability (e.g. in an
entrance hall, but not in an office or an open plan).

• Power consumption. In the worst case, the
prototype draws up to 12.2 W (7.2 W max for LEDs
and 5 W max for the stepper motor). This case
occurs when actuating the ring at full brightness with
the stepper motor in double coils mode (the most
energy-consuming mode). This case will rarely or
never occur. However, because the purpose of the
final ring chart will be to engage users with an energyrelated issue, this chart will have to help in saving
more energy than it consumes.

• Fabrication cost. A ring costs about 200e to build:
60e of raw materials (PLA, PMMA, and plywood)

manufactured using a 3D printer and a 2D laser
cutter; 100e of electronics (NeoPixel digital RGB
LED, stepper motor QSH4218, and micro-switch);
and 40e of bolts, nuts, washers, aluminium profiles,
and other products such as PVC glue and acetone. A
prototype stacking ten expandable illuminated rings
will cost approximately 2000e for the rings plus 300e
of electronics to control it (Raspberry Pi 3, Adafruit
perma-proto HATs, Adafruit stepper motor HATs,
Arduino Mega2560, and ATX power supply).

Conclusion and Future Works
In this paper, we propose to use dynamic physical charts
to foster shifting energy demand in public spaces. We
think that the tangible properties [17] of physical charts

such as the Visibility and Persistance, the Situatedness
and the Tangible representation can help mitigating the
intangibility and the invisibility of energy that drives citizens
away from energy [11]. Therefore, we propose to use
a dynamic physical ring chart for visualizing renewable
energy forecasts. We propose the design of CairnFORM,
a customizable stack of expandable illuminated rings
readable at 360˚ around it. Inspired by existing kinetic
mechanisms, we describe the design process of a first
prototype of an expandable illuminated ring. Furthermore,
we identify several limitations of our final prototype of
an expandable illuminated ring such as the expansion
range, the motion noise, the power consumption, and the
fabrication cost.
In future works, we will manufacture 10 expandable
illuminated rings. With this stack of 10 rings, we will conduct
in vitro user studies to assess the readability of ring charts
when asking users to retrieve incoming peaks of renewable
energy production. Furthermore, we will study in vivo the
attractiveness over weeks and months of such dynamic
physical charts in a public space.
